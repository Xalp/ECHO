Q: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school? Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that 20% of the students took physics and 28% took math. We don't know if there is any overlap between these two groups, so we can't simply add 20% and 28% to get the total number of students.

However, we do know that the total number of students must be greater than 501. Let's use this information to set up an inequality.

Let x be the total number of students in the school. Then we have:

0.20x ≥ number of physics students
0.28x ≥ number of math students

We don't know the exact number of physics or math students, but we do know that the total number of students is greater than 501. So we can write:

0.20x + 0.28x ≥ 501

Simplifying this inequality, we get:

0.48x ≥ 501

Dividing both sides by 0.48, we get:

x ≥ 1043.75

Since x must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a student), the smallest possible value for x is 1044.

Therefore, the answer is (E) none of these, since none

Q: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k = Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51. Let's call the first integer x. Then, the next integer would be x+1, the one after that would be x+2, and so on. 

So, the sum of k consecutive integers starting from x would be:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1)

We can simplify this expression by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

Sum = (n/2)(first term + last term)

In this case, the first term is x and the last term is x+k-1. So, we can write:

x + (x+k-1) = 51

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + k - 1 = 51

2x + k = 52

We also know that the least integer is -50, so we can write:

x = -50

Substituting this into the equation we just derived, we get:

2(-50) + k = 52

-100 + k = 52

k = 152

However, we need to remember that k represents the number

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the square paper. The formula for the area of a square is side x side, so the area of the paper is 20 x 20 = 400 cm².

Next, we need to find the area of the two semi-circles. The formula for the area of a circle is πr², but since we only have semi-circles, we need to divide the result by 2. The diameter of the semi-circles is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm. Therefore, the area of one semi-circle is 1/2 x π x 10² = 50π/2 = 25π cm². The area of two semi-circles is 50π cm².

Finally, we need to subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square paper to find the remaining area. So, the remaining area is 400 - 50π ≈ 8.79 cm².

Therefore, the answer is (B) 8.79.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we need to find the semi-annual interest rate. We can do this by dividing the annual interest rate by 2 since the interest is compounded every six months. 

Annual interest rate = 12%
Semi-annual interest rate = 12% / 2 = 6%

Next, we need to find the number of compounding periods. Since the bond is for 1 year and the interest is compounded every six months, there are 2 compounding periods. 

Number of compounding periods = 2

Now we can use the formula for compound interest to find the total amount of interest accrued at maturity:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the total amount at maturity
P = the principal (initial investment)
r = the interest rate (as a decimal)
n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year
t = the time (in years)

Plugging in the values we have:

A = $5,000(1 + 0.06/2)^(2*1)
A = $5,000(1.03)^2
A = $5,000(1.0609)
A = $

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the probability that exactly four out of five registered voters voted in the last election. We can use the binomial probability formula for this:

P(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

where:
- n is the number of trials (in this case, 5)
- k is the number of successes we want (in this case, 4)
- p is the probability of success (in this case, 0.9)

So, plugging in the values, we get:

P(X = 4) = (5 choose 4) * 0.9^4 * (1-0.9)^(5-4)
          = 5 * 0.9^4 * 0.1^1
          = 0.32805 (rounded to five decimal places)

Next, we need to determine the approximate likelihood of this event. Since we are dealing with probabilities, we can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The conditions for using this approximation are:

- n is large (in this case, 5 is not very large, but we can still use the approximation)
- np >= 10 and n

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of children in the row. We can do this by adding Neha's position from the left end and Radha's position from the right end and subtracting 1 (since they are both included in the count):

Total number of children = 12 + 6 - 1 = 17

Next, we know that when Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places, she will be in the 4th position from the right end (6 - 2 = 4). Similarly, when Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, she will be in the 14th position from the left end (12 + 2 = 14).

Now, we are told that there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. This means that the distance between their new positions is 6 + 1 (including Radha or Neha) = 7.

So, we can set up an equation:

14 (Neha's new position) - 4 (Radha's new position) - 1 (Radha or Neha) = 7

Simplifying this equation, we get:

10 = 7

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25%
A: Let's think step by step. First, let's calculate the cost of purchasing new tires for four years: 

4 years x $180 per tire = $720 per tire 

Now, let's calculate the cost of repairing the current tires for one year: 

1 year x $40 per tire = $40 per tire 

Since the customer has four tires, the total cost of repairing all four tires for one year is: 

4 tires x $40 per tire = $160 

To find the average cost per year of the new tires, we divide the total cost of purchasing new tires for four years by four: 

$720 per tire / 4 years = $180 per year 

To find the percent difference between the cost of purchasing new tires and repairing current tires, we use the following formula: 

(percent difference) = [(new cost - old cost) / old cost] x 100% 

Plugging in the values we calculated: 

(percent difference) = [($180 per year - $160 per year) / $160 per year] x 100% 

(percent difference) = ($20 per year / $160 per year) x 100% 

(percent difference) = 0.125 x 100% 

(percent difference) = 12.5%

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we need to figure out the original price of each article before the 15% discount. Let's call this price "x". 

Then, we know that the price decreased by 15%, so the new price of each article is 0.85x (since 100% - 15% = 85%). 

Next, we know that Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300. This means that the total cost of the articles she bought before the price decrease was 5x, and the total cost of the articles she can buy now is 5(0.85x) = 4.25x. 

We can set up an equation to solve for x: 

5x + 300 = 4.25x + 300 + 5(0.85x) 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

0.9x = 60 

x = 66.67 

So the original price of each article was $66.67. 

Now we can use the 0.85x formula to find the new price of each article: 

0.85(66.67) = $56.67 

Therefore, the new

Answer Choices: (A) 3 hours (B) 5 hours (C) 6 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 7 hours
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that the two cars are travelling in the same direction and the first car is travelling faster than the second car. Therefore, the distance between the two cars will increase over time.

We need to find out how much time it will take for the distance between the two cars to be 15 miles.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula:

distance = rate x time

Let's assume that the distance between the two cars at the start is 0 miles. After t hours, the distance between the two cars will be:

distance = (55 - 52) x t
distance = 3t

We want the distance to be 15 miles, so we can set up an equation:

3t = 15

Solving for t, we get:

t = 5

Therefore, it will take 5 hours for the two cars to be 15 miles away from each other. The answer is (B) 5 hours.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the cost of producing one bag of ice. Since the grocery makes a 20% profit, the cost of producing one bag of ice is 100% - 20% = 80% of the selling price. 

So, the cost of producing one bag of ice is $1.25 / 1.2 = $1.04 (rounded to the nearest cent). 

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling 500 bags of ice. 

Total revenue = selling price x quantity sold = $1.25 x 500 = $625 

Finally, we can calculate the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. 

Total profit = total revenue - total cost = $625 - ($1.04 x 500) = $625 - $520 = $105 

Therefore, the answer is not one of the answer choices given. The correct answer is $105.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Given, the car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr.

So, the distance covered by the car = speed x time = 60 x 20 = 1200 km.

Now, we need to find the speed of the car if the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours.

Let's use the formula, speed = distance/time.

So, the speed of the car = 1200/10 = 120 km/hr.

Therefore, the car gains a speed of 120 - 60 = 60 km/hr.

(Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the number of possible codes using a single letter. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, we can represent 10 types of books using a single letter if we use the first 10 letters of the alphabet. However, we are also allowed to use pairs of two different letters, which gives us more possibilities.

If we use pairs of letters, we can choose any two letters from the alphabet, which gives us 26 choices for the first letter and 25 choices for the second letter (since we can't repeat the first letter). However, since the order of the letters in a pair does not matter, we need to divide by 2 to avoid counting the same pair twice. Therefore, the number of possible codes using a pair of letters is (26 x 25) / 2 = 325.

To find the smallest number of letters we need to create the codes for all 10 types of books, we need to find the smallest number of letters that can represent at least 10 + 325 = 335 different codes. One way to do this is to start with a single letter, which gives us 26 codes, and then add pairs of letters until we reach at least 335 codes.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume Q's age to be x. 

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. 

So, we can say that R's age is (x + y) and T's age is (x - y), where y is the age difference between Q and T. 

Now, we are given that the sum of R and T's age is 50. 

So, (x + y) + (x - y) = 50 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

2x = 50 

x = 25 

So, Q's age is 25. 

Now, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age. 

We know that R's age is (x + y), which is (25 + y). 

We don't know the value of y, so we cannot determine the exact difference between R and Q's age.

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the perimeter of the room. Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5x. Then, the perimeter of the room is 2(2x) + 2(5x) = 14x.

Next, let's find the area of the walls. The area of the walls is the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height of the room, which is (14x)(2x) = 28x^2.

We need to subtract the area of the doors and windows, which is given as 15 sq.m. So, the area of the walls to be papered is 28x^2 - 15.

Now, let's find the length of the paper needed. The length of the paper needed is the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height of the room, which is (14x)(2x) = 28x^2. Since the paper is 50cm wide, we need to divide the length by 0.5 to get the number of meters of paper needed. So, the length of paper needed is 56x.

The cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter, so the total cost is 2(56

Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out the total investment made by A, B, and C. A invested Rs.40,000 for the entire year, B invested Rs.60,000 for 10 months (since he joined after 2 months), and C invested Rs.120,000 for some time period x (since he joined after B).

So, the total investment can be calculated as follows:

Total investment = (A's investment x time) + (B's investment x time) + (C's investment x time)
Total investment = (Rs.40,000 x 12) + (Rs.60,000 x 10) + (Rs.120,000 x x)
Total investment = Rs.480,000 + Rs.600,000 + Rs.120,000x
Total investment = Rs.1,200,000 + Rs.120,000x

Next, we need to find out the share of A and B in the profit. Since C gets Rs.150,000 as his share, the remaining profit is Rs.375,000 - Rs.150,000 = Rs.225,000.

The share of A and B can be calculated as follows:

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total speed at which they are biking together. To do this, we add their individual speeds: 

10 mph + 20 mph = 30 mph 

So, together they are biking at a speed of 30 miles per hour. 

Next, we need to find how long it will take them to collectively bike 1 mile. We can use the formula: 

distance = rate x time 

In this case, the distance is 1 mile and the rate is 30 mph. We want to solve for time, so we can rearrange the formula: 

time = distance / rate 

Plugging in the values: 

time = 1 mile / 30 mph 

Simplifying: 

time = 1/30 hour 

Converting to minutes: 

time = (1/30) x 60 minutes

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the athlete's speed for running M miles in 4 hours. We can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

So, the athlete's speed for running is:

Miles per hour = M / 4

Next, we need to find the athlete's speed for riding a bike N miles in 4 hours. Again, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

So, the athlete's speed for riding a bike is:

Miles per hour = N / 4

To find the average speed for these two activities combined, we need to add the distances and divide by the total time. The total distance is M + N, and the total time is 4 + 4 = 8 hours. So, the average speed is:

Average speed = (M + N) / 8

Therefore, the answer is (A) M + N / 8.

If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125
A: Let's think step by step. First, let's define some variables:
- Let V be the number of files infected by a virus.
- Let W be the number of files infected by a worm.
- Let VW be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

From the problem statement, we know that:
- V + W - VW = 250 (since all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
- W = 2.5VW (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm)
- V = 0.5(250) = 125 (since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus)

We can use these equations to solve for VW and W:
- V + W - VW = 250
- 125 + W - VW = 250 (substituting V = 125)
- W - VW = 125
- W - 2.5W = 125 (substituting W = 2.5VW)
- -1.5W = 125
- W = -83.33 (this doesn't make sense, so we made a mistake somewhere)

 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not given. We need to check our work and find where we made a mistake.

Q: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how long it takes Jack to clean the entire yacht. We know that he can clean it in 12 hours, so we can set up the equation:

1 yacht / 12 hours = Jack's cleaning rate

Next, we need to figure out how much of the yacht Jack cleaned on the particular day. We know that he finished two-thirds of the work, so we can set up another equation:

2/3 yacht = Jack's progress

Now we need to figure out how much of the yacht is left for Jill to clean. We can subtract Jack's progress from the total amount of work:

1 yacht - 2/3 yacht = 1/3 yacht

So Jill needs to clean one-third of the yacht. We also know that Jill's cleaning rate is only 5% of Jack's cleaning rate, so we can set up another equation:

1/3 yacht / (0.05 * Jack's cleaning rate) = Jill's cleaning time

Now we just need to substitute in the values we know. We can use the first equation to find Jack's cleaning rate:

1 yacht / 12 hours = Jack's cleaning rate

Jack's cleaning rate = 1/12 yacht per hour

We can use this

Q: In the coordinate plane, a triangle has vertices at (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y). If a>x>b>0>y, which of the following represents the area of that triangle? Answer Choices: (A)  (ay−by) /2 (B)  (ab−ay) /2 (C)  (by−ay) /2 (D)  (ay+by) /x (E)  (a−b) /2y
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

First, we need to plot the given points on the coordinate plane. We have (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y). Since a>x>b and 0>y, we can assume that the triangle is in the fourth quadrant.

Next, we need to find the base and height of the triangle. The base is the distance between (a,0) and (b,0), which is simply |a-b|. The height is the distance between (x,y) and the x-axis, which is simply |y|.

Finally, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is (base * height) / 2. Substituting the values we found, we get:

Area = (|a-b| * |y|) / 2

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Area = (ab - ay - by + ay) / 2

Area = (ab - by) / 2

Therefore, the answer is (B) (ab - ay) / 2. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) (ab - ay) / 2.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday. We know that 10% of the staplers produced were defective, so 90% of the staplers produced were non-defective. 

Let's assume that the total number of staplers produced on Monday was x. Then, the number of non-defective staplers produced would be 0.9x. 

Next, we know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. We are given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up an equation: 

0.02(0.9x) = 72 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

0.018x = 72 

x = 4000 

Therefore, the total number of staplers produced on Monday was 4000.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time difference between the two trains. Train M travels for 4 hours (from 5 am to 9 am) and Train N travels for 3.5 hours (from 7 am to 10:30 am). So, the time difference between the two trains is 1.5 hours.

Next, we need to find the relative speed of the two trains. Since they are moving towards each other, we need to add their speeds. Let's say the speed of Train M is x km/hr and the speed of Train N is y km/hr. Then, their relative speed is (x+y) km/hr.

Now, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time. The distance covered by Train M in 1.5 hours is (x+y) x 1.5 km. Similarly, the distance covered by Train N in 1.5 hours is (x+y) x 1.5 km.

Since the two trains meet each other at some point, the sum of their distances should be equal to the distance between City A and City B, which is the total distance they cover in the entire journey. Let's say this distance is d km.

So, we can write the equation:

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we need to understand the concept of similar triangles. When two triangles have the same shape but different sizes, they are called similar triangles. In this problem, the two ants are standing side-by-side, so we can assume that they are both standing straight up and down, and their shadows are being cast by the same light source.

Next, we can set up a proportion to find the length of the taller ant's shadow. We know that the ratio of the height of the shorter ant to the length of its shadow is 4:10. We can write this as:

4/10 = 6/x

where x is the length of the taller ant's shadow.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

4x = 60

x = 15

Therefore, the length of the taller ant's shadow is 15 inches. The answer is (D) 15. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 15.

If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day? Answer Choices: (A) 80 (B) 120 (C) 240 (D) 320 (E) 360
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, which means it sold 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls. 

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, we know that half of the 480 sold were white golf balls. Therefore, the store had 240 white golf balls to begin the day. 

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know that the remaining 240 golf balls must be yellow. Therefore, the store had 240 yellow golf balls to begin the day. 

So the answer is (C) 240.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that Arjun has x amount of money and Sajal has y amount of money.

According to the first condition, if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. So, we can write the equation:

y + 30 = 2(x - 30)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

y + 30 = 2x - 60
y = 2x - 90

According to the second condition, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10 = 3(y - 10)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x + 10 = 3y - 30
x = 3y - 40

Now, we can substitute the value of y from the first equation into the second equation:

x = 3(2x - 90) - 40
x = 6x - 300 - 40
x = 5x - 340
x = 340

Substituting the value of x into the first equation 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 62, 34. Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that 27 bottles of soda cost A cents. So, the cost of one bottle of soda would be A/27 cents.

Now, we need to find out how much B bottles of soda would cost in dollars. To do this, we need to convert the cost of one bottle from cents to dollars by dividing it by 100.

So, the cost of one bottle of soda in dollars would be A/27 / 100 = A/2700 dollars.

To find the cost of B bottles of soda, we need to multiply the cost of one bottle by B.

Therefore, the cost of B bottles of soda in dollars would be (A/2700) * B = AB/2700.

So, the answer is (A) AB/2700.

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use variables to represent the number of newspapers bought on Sunday and the number bought on the rest of the days of the week. Let's call the number bought on Sunday "s" and the number bought on the rest of the days of the week "r". 

We know that the hotel buys twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, so we can write:

s = 2r 

We also know that the hotel pays $4 for each Sunday paper and $1 for each paper on the rest of the days of the week. So the total cost per week can be written as:

4s + 1r + 1r + 1r + 1r + 1r + 1r = 210 

Simplifying this equation, we get:

4s + 6r = 210 

Now we can substitute the first equation (s = 2r) into the second equation:

4(2r) + 6r = 210 

Simplifying this equation, we get:

14r = 210 

Dividing both sides by 14, we get:

r = 15 

So the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the probability that both Stock A and Stock B will increase in value during the next month. We can do this by multiplying the probabilities: 

0.56 x 0.74 = 0.4144 

Next, we need to find the probability that at least one of the stocks will increase in value. We can do this by subtracting the probability that neither of the stocks will increase from 1: 

1 - (0.56 + 0.74 - 0.4144) = 1 - 0.8856 = 0.1144 

Finally, we need to find the greatest value for the probability that neither of the two events will occur. This is simply the probability we just calculated: 

0.1144

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

To find the number of ways in which 2 oranges can be chosen from the basket, we need to use the combination formula. The formula for combination is:

nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!

where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to be chosen, and ! denotes factorial (i.e., the product of all positive integers up to that number).

In this case, n = 10 (since there are 10 oranges in the basket) and r = 2 (since we want to choose 2 oranges). So, we can plug these values into the formula:

10C2 = 10! / 2!(10-2)!
      = 10! / 2!8!
      = (10 x 9 x 8!) / (2 x 1 x 8!)
      = (10 x 9) / (2 x 1)
      = 45

Therefore, the answer is (A) 45.

Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that all 20 marbles pulled out the first time were white, since the bag only contained white marbles at the beginning. Then, one black marble was pulled out of the second set of 20 marbles, so the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 1/20 or 5%.

Let's use algebra to solve for the total number of marbles in the bag. Let W be the number of white marbles in the bag and B be the number of black marbles. We know that after the first set of 20 marbles were pulled out and put back in, the ratio of white to black marbles remained the same. So:

(W+20)/(B+20) = W/B

Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get:

WB + 20B = W(B+20)
20B = 20W
B = W

So the bag contains an equal number of white and black marbles. Let's call this number X. Then the total number of marbles in the bag is 2X (since there are X white marbles and X black marbles).

We know that the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%, so:

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide, so let's call that side "x" and the other side "y". 

We also know that the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, so we can set up an equation: 

x * y = 3,000 

Now we can solve for y: 

y = 3,000 / x 

We also know that x = 100, so we can substitute that in: 

y = 3,000 / 100 

y = 30 

Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we know that there are n balls in the box, marked successively from 1 to n.

Next, we need to consider the number of ways that two balls can be selected from the box. This is given by the formula n choose 2, which is equal to n(n-1)/2.

However, we also know that if the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, there are only 45 different ways that two balls can be selected. This means that we need to subtract the number of ways that include the ball with number 3 from the total number of ways.

To do this, we can consider the number of ways that include the ball with number 3. There are n-1 balls left to choose from, and we need to choose one of them to pair with the ball marked 3. This gives us (n-1) choose 1, which simplifies to n-1.

Therefore, the number of ways that do not include the ball with number 3 is equal to n(n-1)/2 - (n-1). We know that this is equal to 45, so we can set up the equation:

n(n-1)/

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Let's say the actual number is x.

The student found the value of 7/18 of the number, which is (7/18)x.

But the student was supposed to find the value of 7/8 of the number, which is (7/8)x.

So the difference between the two values is:

(7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770

Simplifying this equation, we get:

(77/72)x = 770

Multiplying both sides by 72/77, we get:

x = 840

Therefore, the actual number is 840.

A: Let's think step by step. First, A travels 3 km south, which means A is 3 km away from home in the south direction.

Then, A travels 5 km towards the east, which means A is 5 km away from home in the east direction.

Next, A travels 3 km towards the north, which means A is 3 km away from home in the north direction.

Finally, A travels 2 km towards the west, which means A is 2 km away from home in the west direction.

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between A and home. The distance between A and home is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 3 km (north) and 5 km (east) and 2 km (west). 

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get:

distance^2 = 3^2 + 5^2 + 2^2
distance^2 = 9 + 25 + 4
distance^2 = 38
distance = sqrt(38)

Therefore, A is approximately 6.16 km away from home.

Q can eat half the jar in 5 minutes, so her rate of eating is 1/10 of the jar per minute.

When they eat together, their rates of eating add up. So, their combined rate of eating is 1/10 + 1/5 = 3/10 of the jar per minute.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take them to empty the jar. Let's call this time 't'.

We know that their combined rate of eating is 3/10 of the jar per minute. So, we can set up the equation:

(3/10) * t = x

This equation says that the amount of candy they eat in 't' minutes (3/10 of the jar per minute) is equal to the total amount of candy in the jar (x).

Now, we can solve for 't':

t = (10/3) * x

This means that it will take them (10/3) * x minutes 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not a whole number, so we need to round up to the nearest integer.

Q: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ? Answer Choices: (A) Rs 400 (B) Rs 500 (C) Rs 600 (D) Rs 700 (E) Rs 800
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of people who will receive the money: 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11 people.

Next, we need to find the amount each nephew will receive. Let's call this amount "x". Then, each daughter will receive 4x and each son will receive 5x.

So, the total amount of money distributed will be:

2x + 4x(4 daughters) + 5x(5 sons) = 8600

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + 16x + 25x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200

Therefore, each daughter will receive 4x = 4(200) = 800.

So, the answer is (E) Rs 800.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. This means that each man can do 1/x of the work in one day. Therefore, x men can do x/x = 1 unit of work in one day.

Now, we need to find out how much work y men can do in y days working y hours per day. Each man can do 1/y of the work in one day, so y men can do y/y = 1 unit of work in one day. They will be working for y days, so they can do a total of 1 x y = y units of work.

To summarize, y men working y hours per day can do y units of work in y days.

Q: On a test the passing students had an average of 83, while the failing students had an average
of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed? Answer Choices: (A) 44% (B) 66% (C) 68% (D) 72% (E) 75%
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the proportion of passing students and failing students in the class. Let's assume that there are x passing students and y failing students in the class.

We know that the passing students had an average of 83, so the total score of all passing students is 83x. Similarly, the failing students had an average of 55, so the total score of all failing students is 55y.

The overall class average was 76, so the total score of all students in the class is 76(x+y).

Now we can set up an equation to solve for x, the number of passing students:

(83x + 55y) / (x + y) = 76

Multiplying both sides by (x + y), we get:

83x + 55y = 76(x + y)

Expanding the brackets, we get:

83x + 55y = 76x + 76y

Subtracting 76x and 55y from both sides, we get:

7x = 21y

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

x = 3y

So there are three times as many passing students as failing students in the class.

Now we can find

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that B bisects minor arc AC, which means that the measure of minor arc AB is equal to the measure of minor arc BC. 

Since minor arc AC is 160°, we can find the measure of minor arc AB by dividing 160° by 2, which gives us 80°. 

Similarly, we can find the measure of minor arc BC by subtracting 80° from 160°, which gives us 80° as well. 

Now, we know that minor arc BD is 150°, and we can find the measure of minor arc AD by adding the measures of minor arcs AB, BD, and DC. 

Minor arc AB is 80°, minor arc BD is 150°, and minor arc DC is also 80° (since it is equal to minor arc BC). 

Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 80° + 150° + 80° = 310°. 

However, we need to remember that we are dealing with a circle, and the measure of a full circle is 360°. 

So, we need to subtract 310° from 360° to find the measure of minor arc AD within the circle.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the cost price of the book. We know that the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. 

Let CP be the cost price of the book. 

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price 

10% of CP = Rs 27.50 - CP 

0.1CP = Rs 27.50 - CP 

1.1CP = Rs 27.50 

CP = Rs 25 

So, the cost price of the book is Rs 25. 

Now, we need to find the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75. 

Profit/Loss = Selling Price - Cost Price 

If the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, 

Profit/Loss = Rs. 25.75 - Rs. 25 

Profit/Loss = Rs. 0.75 

To find the percentage, we need to divide the profit/loss by the cost price and multiply by 100. 

Profit/Loss percentage = (Profit/Loss ÷ Cost Price) x 100 

Profit/Loss percentage = (0.75 ÷ 25) x 100 

Profit/Loss percentage = 3% Profit

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to convert the 7 pounds to ounces. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, we can multiply 7 by 16 to get:

7 pounds = 112 ounces

112 ounces + 4 ounces = 116 ounces

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate how many quarter-miles we can travel with the initial $3.50 charge. 

$3.50 ÷ $0.10 = 35 quarter-miles 

This means we can travel 35 quarter-miles with the initial charge. 

Next, we need to calculate how many quarter-miles we can travel with the remaining $5. 

$5 ÷ $0.10 = 50 quarter-miles 

So, in total, we can travel 35 + 50 = 85 quarter-miles. 

To convert this to miles, we divide by 4: 

85 ÷ 4 = 21.25 miles 

However, we need to subtract the initial quarter-mile that was included in the initial charge: 

21.25 - 0.25 = 21 miles 

Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is 21 miles. 

The answer choice closest to this value is (D) 14.75 miles, but this is not the correct answer.

What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ? Answer Choices: (A) 21 (B) 30 (C) 31 (D) 32 (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year. We can do this by multiplying the average of 20 by the number of months, which is 10. 

20 x 10 = 200 

So, the store sold a total of 200 microwave ovens in the first 10 months of this year. 

Next, we need to find the total number of microwave ovens sold in the entire 22 months period. We can do this by multiplying the average of 42 by the number of months, which is 22. 

42 x 22 = 924 

So, the store sold a total of 924 microwave ovens in the entire 22 months period. 

Finally, we can find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period by dividing the total number of microwave ovens sold by the number of months. 

924 / 22 = 42 

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period is 42.

Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 22 (D) 24 (E) 26
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we need to find the total amount of money they have in their bribery pool. We can do this by adding Hoopsmot's contribution of $16,000 to Smolapon's contribution of $4,000:

$16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000

Next, we need to find out how much money each senator is worth. We can do this by dividing the total amount of money by the number of senators they can influence:

$20,000 ÷ 30 senators = $666.67 per senator

Now we can figure out how many senators Hoopsmot can influence based on his contribution. We can do this by dividing his contribution by the value of each senator:

$16,000 ÷ $666.67 per senator = 24 senators

Therefore, the answer is (D) 24 senators.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to understand the concept of similar triangles. When two triangles have the same shape but different sizes, they are called similar triangles. In this problem, we have two similar triangles - one formed by the electric pole, its shadow, and the sun's rays, and the other formed by the tree, its shadow, and the sun's rays.

Now, let's use the concept of proportions to find the height of the tree. We know that the height of the electric pole is 14 metres and its shadow is 10 metres. So, the ratio of the height to the shadow is 14/10 or 1.4.

Similarly, for the tree, we know that its shadow is 15 metres. Let's assume its height is h metres. So, the ratio of the height to the shadow is h/15.

Since the two triangles are similar, these ratios should be equal. Therefore, we can write:

1.4 = h/15

Solving for h, we get:

h = 1.4 x 15 = 21

Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 metres. So, the answer is (A) 21.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that the bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them. This means that out of every 1000 flowers, the bee will bypass 0.05 x 1000 = 50 flowers.

Now, we need to figure out how many flowers the bee will fly by to bypass 8 flowers. We can set up a proportion:

50 flowers / 1000 flowers = 8 flowers / x flowers

Solving for x, we get:

x = (1000 x 8) / 50 = 160

Therefore, the bee will fly by 160 flowers to bypass 8 flowers.

However, this is not one of the answer choices. We need to convert 160 to one of the answer choices. We can do this by multiplying 160 by 50:

160 x 50 = 8000

Therefore, the answer is (C) 8000.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's start by finding the speed of car X. 

Speed = Distance / Time 

Speed of car X = 320 kms / 8 hrs = 40 kms/hr 

Now, let's find the speed of car Y. 

Speed of car Y = 415 kms / 5 hrs = 83 kms/hr

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that exactly 2/5th of the children in the class are girls. This means that 3/5th of the children are boys.

We also know that there are 100 boys in the class. So, we can set up an equation to find the total number of children in the class:

3/5 * Total number of children = 100

To solve for the total number of children, we can multiply both sides by 5/3:

Total number of children = 100 * 5/3 = 166.67 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

However, we know that the total number of children must be a whole number, so we can round up to 167.

Now that we know the total number of children in the class, we can find the number of girls by multiplying the total number of children by 2/5:

Number of girls = 167 * 2/5 = 66.8 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Again, we round up to get the final answer:

Number of girls = 67

Therefore, the answer is (E) 70 is not correct. The correct answer is (A) 50.

holidays. The bill for that month would be : Answer Choices: (A) Rs.1560 (B) Rs.1680 (C) Rs.1840 (D) Rs.1950 (E) Rs.1690
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the fixed portion of the bill. We can do this by using the information given in the first two sentences of the problem. Let's call the fixed portion "F" and the variable portion "V". 

We know that when 540 calls are made, the bill is Rs.1800. We can use this information to set up an equation: 

1800 = F + 540V 

Similarly, when 620 calls are made, the bill is Rs.2040: 

2040 = F + 620V 

Now we have two equations with two variables (F and V). We can solve for F by subtracting the second equation from the first: 

1800 - 2040 = (F + 540V) - (F + 620V) 

-240 = -80V 

V = 3 

Now we can substitute this value of V into either of the original equations to solve for F: 

1800 = F + 540(3) 

F = 1800 - 1620 

F = 180 

So the fixed portion of the bill is Rs.180, and the variable portion is Rs.3 per call. 

To find the bill for the month with

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we know that the yard has an area of 240 square meters. Let's use this information to find the length and width of the yard.

We can start by listing all the possible pairs of factors of 240:

1 x 240
2 x 120
3 x 80
4 x 60
5 x 48
6 x 40
8 x 30
10 x 24
12 x 20

Out of these pairs, we can see that 12 x 20 gives us a rectangular yard with an area of 240 square meters.

Next, we know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. Let's use this information to find the length and width of the fenced area.

If we let x be the width of the fenced area, then the length of the fenced area would be 20 - x (since the total length of the yard is 20 meters).

We also know that the area of the fenced area is 240 square meters minus the area of the unfenced area (which is 20 meters x 10 meters = 200 square meters). So the area of

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that x is negative and y is positive. 

Next, we can simplify the inequality |x^3| > |y^2| by taking the cube root of both sides (since x is negative, we need to flip the inequality sign): 

-x > y^(2/3)

Now we can square both sides to get rid of the cube root: 

x^2 < y^(4/3)

Finally, we can square both sides again to get rid of the fractional exponent: 

x^4 < y^(8/3)

So we know that x^4 is less than y raised to some power. 

Looking at the answer choices, we can eliminate (A) and (B) because we don't have enough information to determine the relationship between x and y squared or x and y. 

We can also eliminate (C) because the inequality sign is pointing in the wrong direction. 

That leaves us with (D) and (E). 

To determine which one is true, we can take the fourth root of both sides of our inequality: 

x < y^(2/3)

Q: A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance? Answer Choices: (A) $27.30 (B) $51.00 (C) $63.00 (D) $70.00 (E) $91.00
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that the retailer sold the appliance for 40% above cost, which means the selling price is 140% of the cost price. 

Let's represent the cost price as "C". 

So, the selling price can be calculated as 1.4C. 

We also know that the gross profit is $20. 

Gross profit = Selling price - Cost price 

$20 = 1.4C - C 

$20 = 0.4C 

C = $50 

Therefore, the cost price of the appliance is $50. 

Now, we can calculate the selling price: 

Selling price = 1.4C = 1.4($50) = $70 

So, the retailer sold the appliance for $70. 

Therefore, the answer is (D) $70. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) $70.

Q: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 12 (C) 16 (D) 24 (E) 25
A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that all the friends who planned to go on the picnic showed up. In that case, each person would have to contribute Rs. 96 divided by the total number of friends.

Let's call the total number of friends "x". So, each person would have to contribute Rs. 96/x.

Now, we know that four friends did not show up. So, the number of people who actually attended the picnic is x-4.

We also know that each person had to contribute Rs. 4 extra because of the four missing friends. So, the new contribution per person is Rs. 96/(x-4) + 4.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

96/x = 96/(x-4) + 4

Now, we can solve for x:

96/x - 96/(x-4) = 4

Multiplying both sides by x(x-4), we get:

96(x-4) - 96x = 4x(x-4)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

-384 = -4x^2 + 16x

Rearranging, we get:

4x^2 - 16x - 384 =

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450, which means the cost per kg is:

450/90 = Rs. 5 per kg

The merchant sold the oranges at Rs. 7.50 per kg, which means the selling price for 90 kg is:

90 x 7.50 = Rs. 675

To calculate the percentage gain, we need to find the profit first. Profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = Rs. 675 - Rs. 450
Profit = Rs. 225

Now, we can calculate the percentage gain using the formula:

Percentage gain = (Profit / Cost price) x 100

Percentage gain = (225 / 450) x 100
Percentage gain = 50%

Therefore, the answer is (A) 50%.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find all the possible combinations of selecting 3 candy bars from the 11. This can be done using the combination formula: 

nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!

where n is the total number of candy bars (11) and r is the number of candy bars we want to select (3). 

nCr = 11! / 3!(11-3)! = 11! / 3!8! = 165

So there are 165 possible combinations of selecting 3 candy bars from the 11. 

Next, we need to find the combinations where the total cost is more than $4. We can do this by listing out all the possible combinations and calculating their total cost. However, this would be time-consuming and prone to errors. 

Instead, we can use a shortcut by noticing that the only way to get a total cost of more than $4 is to select at least one candy bar that costs $2. This is because selecting three candy bars that cost $1 each would only give a total cost of $3, which is less than $4. 

So, we can break down the problem into two cases: 

Case 1: Selecting one candy bar that costs

Q: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the yearly production cost of the company. Since they produce 420 units every month, the yearly production cost will be:

Yearly production cost = 420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months = $554,400

Next, we need to calculate the yearly revenue from sales. Since they sell all of the components every month, the yearly revenue will be:

Yearly revenue = 420 units/month x selling price/unit x 12 months

Now, we can set up an equation for the yearly profit:

Yearly profit = Yearly revenue - Yearly production cost

We know that the minimum yearly profit should be $626,400, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

$626,400 = 420 units/month x selling price/unit x 12 months - $554,400

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$1,180,800 = 420 x selling price

Dividing both sides by 420, we get:

selling price = $2,800

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $2,800/420 = $266.67, which is closest to answer choice (D)

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the probability of at least one of the events A or B occurring is 0.96. This means that the probability of neither A nor B occurring is 0.04 (since the sum of probabilities must equal 1).

Next, we know that events A and B are independent. This means that the probability of both A and B occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B).

We can use these two pieces of information to set up an equation:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 x P(B))

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0.36 = 0.4 x P(B)

P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9, which is answer choice (E).

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we know that 60% of the people who took the survey were women. This means that 40% of the people who took the survey were men.

Next, we know that of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. This means that 25% of the men who were surveyed preferred green cars over red cars.

We also know that 10 men liked green cars more than red. This means that there were 40 men who preferred red cars over green cars (since 25% of the men preferred green cars, and 10 men liked green cars more than red).

To find out how many people took the survey, we can use the information we have about the men who were surveyed. If 40 men preferred red cars over green cars, and men made up 40% of the people who took the survey, then we can set up the following equation:

0.4x = 40

where x is the total number of people who took the survey.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 100

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find the area of the rectangular piece of cloth. Since the original piece was a square, its area was $s^2$, where $s$ is the length of one side. When we trim 4 feet from one edge, we get a rectangle with one side equal to $s-4$ and the other side equal to $s$. So the area of the rectangle is $(s-4)s = s^2 - 4s$.

Next, we cut the rectangle diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet, so the total area of the rectangle is $2 \times 70 = 140$ square feet.

We can set up an equation to solve for $s$: 

$s^2 - 4s = 140$

$s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0$

$(s-14)(s+10) = 0$

$s = 14$ (since $s$ must be positive)

So the original piece of cloth had a side length of 14 feet. 

To find the perimeter, we add up the lengths of all four sides: 

$4s = 4 \times 14 = 56$

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Without a membership, the cost of renting one DVD is $4.00.

With a membership, the cost of renting one DVD is $2.00.

To make it worth it to purchase the membership, we need to figure out how many DVDs we need to rent to save at least $7.00 (the cost of the membership).

Let's start with renting one DVD. Without a membership, it would cost $4.00. With a membership, it would cost $2.00. So we would save $2.00.

To make up for the cost of the membership ($7.00), we would need to rent at least 4 DVDs (4 x $2.00 = $8.00, which is greater than $7.00).

Therefore, the minimum amount of DVDs we would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership is (D) 4.

Principal amount (P) = Rs. 500

Rate of interest (R) = 6% per annum

Time period (T) = 4 years

Simple Interest (SI) = (P * R * T) / 100

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the volume of the coin made of alloy. The volume of a cylinder (which is the shape of the coin) is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where r is the radius (half of the diameter) and h is the height (thickness). 

In this case, r = 7.5 mm (half of 15 mm) and h = 2 mm, so V = π(7.5)^2(2) = 352.7 mm^3. 

Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, we can assume that half of the volume is aluminum and half is silver. Therefore, the volume of aluminum is 176.4 mm^3. 

Next, we need to find the weight of the aluminum in the alloy coin. We know that the weight of the entire coin is 30 grams, so we need to find the fraction of the volume that is aluminum and multiply it by the total weight. 

The density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3, so the weight of the aluminum in the alloy coin is (176.4/1000) * 2.7 * 30 = 14.3 grams. 

Now we can use

If his income increases by 20%, then his new income will be $120. 

To find his new expenditure, we need to find 70% of $120, which is $84.

How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 12 (D) 6 (E) 3
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much of the pool hose A can fill in one hour. Since it can fill the pool in 8 hours, it can fill 1/8 of the pool in one hour.

Next, we need to find out how much of the pool both hoses can fill in one hour. We know that they finished filling the pool in 3 hours, and that hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours. So, both hoses worked together for 1 hour to fill the remaining portion of the pool. Therefore, both hoses can fill 1/3 of the pool in one hour.

Now, we can use the information we have to set up an equation. Let x be the fraction of the pool that hose B can fill in one hour. We know that:

1/8 + 1/x = 1/3

We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 24x:

3x + 24 = 8x

24 = 5x

x = 4.8

Therefore, hose B can fill 4.8% of the pool in one hour. To find out how long it would take hose B to fill the entire pool, we can set up another equation:

First, we need to figure out how much money is exchanged for each flip. If the coin lands on heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan. If it lands on tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher. So the net exchange for each flip is $1 from Jonathan to Christopher.

Next, we know that after 20 flips, neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money. This means that the total amount exchanged must be $0. Since each flip results in a net exchange of $1 from Jonathan to Christopher, we know that there must have been 20 flips where Jonathan gave $1 to Christopher.

Therefore, the coin landed on heads 10 times (since Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan for each head). So the answer is (A) 10.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Let's call the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies as "x".

We know that the number of water lilies doubles every two days. So, after two days, there will be 2 water lilies, after four days, there will be 4 water lilies, and so on.

If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. This means that after 58 days, there were 32 water lilies on the lake (since it doubles every two days). After 59 days, there were 64 water lilies on the lake.

So, we can set up an equation:

1 x 2^(x/2) = 64

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2^(x/2) = 64

2^(x/2) = 2^6

x/2 = 6

x = 12

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 12 days if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the average of the highest and lowest scores is x. Therefore, the sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x.

Next, we know that the average score for the entire class is y. Therefore, the sum of all the scores in the class is yz.

To find the sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to subtract the sum of the highest and lowest scores from the sum of all the scores in the class. This gives us:

yz - 2x

To find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to divide this sum by the number of students in the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. Since there are two students who are excluded, the number of students in the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is z - 2. Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:

(yz - 2x) / (z - 2)

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we need to find out how fast Bill is traveling on a windy day. We know that his normal speed is 15 mph, but on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. So, his speed on a windy day would be:

15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph

Next, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours, since we have Bill's speed in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

21 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 0.35 hours

Now, we can use the formula:

distance = speed x time

to find out how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. Plugging in the values we have:

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours
distance = 3.85 miles

So, the answer is (D) 3.85 miles.

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that the wholesale cost of the appliance is $100. 

According to the problem, the original retail price of the appliance was 60% more than its wholesale cost. So, 

Original retail price = Wholesale cost + 60% of Wholesale cost 
= $100 + 60%*$100 
= $160 

Now, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So, 

Sale price = Original retail price - 20% of Original retail price 
= $160 - 20%*$160 
= $128 

We need to find the percentage by which the appliance was sold for more than its wholesale cost. 

Profit = Sale price - Wholesale cost 
= $128 - $100 
= $28 

Profit percentage = (Profit/Wholesale cost)*100 
= (28/100)*100 
= 28%

Q: Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Let the distance between Winson's home and school be "d" miles.

Let the time taken to run from home to school be "t1" hours.

Let the time taken to walk from school to home be "t2" hours.

We know that the total time taken for the whole journey is 1 hour.

So, we can write the equation:

t1 + t2 = 1

We also know that the distance between home and school is the same for both the run and the walk.

So, we can write another equation:

distance = speed x time

For the run from home to school:

d = 10t1

For the walk from school to home:

d = 5t2

Now, we can substitute the value of "d" from the second equation into the first equation:

10t1 = 5t2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2t1 = t2

Now, we can substitute the value of "t2" in terms of "t1" into the equation t1 + t2 = 1:

t1 + 2t1 = 1

3t1 = 1

t1 = 1 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not given. We need to find the distance "d" between Winson's home and school.

Using the equation d = 10t1, we can

Q: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are Answer Choices: (A) 600, 400 (B) 628, 372 (C) 640, 360 (D) None of these (E) Cannot be determined
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent the problem. Let x and y be the two numbers. Then we have:

x^2 - y^2 = 256000  (since the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000)
x + y = 1000  (since the sum of the numbers is 1000)

We can use the second equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. For example, we can solve for y:

y = 1000 - x

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

x^2 - (1000 - x)^2 = 256000

Expanding the square and simplifying, we get:

-2000x + 1000000 = 256000

Solving for x, we get:

x = 628 or x = 372

Substituting these values back into the equation y = 1000 - x, we get:

y = 372 or y = 628

Therefore, the two numbers are either 372 and 628, or 628 and 372. So the answer is (B) 628, 372. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 628, 372.

Q: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? Answer Choices: (A) 15.38% (B) 42% (C) 39.86% (D) 22.35% (E) 32.51%
A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume John starts with 100 ml of 50% strong milk tea. He replaces 15% of it with milk twice, which means he adds 15 ml of milk each time. After the first replacement, he has 85 ml of 50% strong milk tea and 15 ml of milk. After the second replacement, he has 72.25 ml of 50% strong milk tea and 27.75 ml of milk.

Next, he replaces 10% of this resultant solution with more milk. 10% of 72.25 ml is 7.225 ml. So, he adds 7.225 ml of milk to the solution.

Now, the total volume of the solution is 100 ml (original tea) + 15 ml (first milk addition) + 15 ml (second milk addition) + 7.225 ml (third milk addition) = 137.225 ml.

The total amount of milk in the solution is 15 ml (first milk addition) + 15 ml (second milk addition) + 7.225 ml (third milk addition) = 37.225 ml.

Therefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is (72.25/137.225) x

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose 4 points out of the 5 points A, B, C, D, and E. This can be done in 5 choose 4 ways, which is 5.

Next, we need to consider the different types of quadrilaterals that can be formed. There are two cases:

Case 1: The quadrilateral includes the center F. In this case, we can choose any 3 points out of A, B, C, D, and E to form a triangle, and then connect the remaining point to F. There are 5 choose 3 ways to choose the 3 points, which is 10. Therefore, there are 10 quadrilaterals in this case.

Case 2: The quadrilateral does not include the center F. In this case, we can choose any 4 points out of A, B, C, D, and E to form a quadrilateral. There are 5 choose 4 ways to choose the 4 points, which is 5. Therefore, there are 5 quadrilaterals in this case.

Adding up the number of quadrilaterals in each case, we get a total of 10 + 5 = 15 quadrilaterals. Therefore, the

(Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from the team of 8 people. This is simply 8 choose 4, which is 70.

Next, we need to subtract the number of groups that consist of only men or only women. There are 4 men and 4 women, so the number of groups that consist of only men is 4 choose 4, which is 1. Similarly, the number of groups that consist of only women is also 1.

Therefore, the total number of groups that we need to exclude is 1 + 1 = 2.

Finally, we can subtract the number of groups that we need to exclude from the total number of groups, which is 70 - 2 = 68.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 19.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to check if the first number in each pair is a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive. We can see that all the answer choices satisfy this condition.

Next, we need to check if the second number in each pair is less than or equal to the square root of the first. Let's calculate the square root of the first number in each pair:

- (99,10): sqrt(99) ≈ 9.95, which is greater than 10. This pair does not satisfy the routine.
- (85,9): sqrt(85) ≈ 9.22, which is greater than 9. This pair does not satisfy the routine.
- (50,7): sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07, which is equal to 7. This pair satisfies the routine.
- (1,1): sqrt(1) = 1, which is equal to 1. This pair satisfies the routine.
- (1,0): sqrt(1) = 1, which is greater than 0. This pair satisfies the routine.

Therefore, the answer is (A) (99,10) because the second number in this pair is greater than the square root of the first.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the dimensions of the rectangular plot. We know that the perimeter is 340 meters, so we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: 

P = 2(l + w)

where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width. 

Substituting the given value of P, we get: 

340 = 2(l + w)

Simplifying, we get: 

170 = l + w 

Now, we need to add 2 meters to both the length and width to account for the 1-meter broad boundary on each side. 

So, the new length and width will be: 

l + 2 and w + 2 

The area of the rectangular plot with the boundary will be: 

A = (l + 2)(w + 2) 

Expanding, we get: 

A = lw + 2l + 2w + 4 

We know that the rate is 10 per square meter, so the cost will be: 

Cost = 10A 

Substituting the value of A, we get: 

Cost = 10(lw + 2l + 2w + 4)

A: Let's think step by step. To travel from M to Q, we need to take 3 buses from M to N, 4 buses from N to O, 1 bus from O to P, and 3 buses from P to Q. 

So, the total number of ways to travel from M to Q is the product of the number of ways to take each leg of the journey. 

Number of ways to take 3 buses from M to N = 3 (since we have 3 options for each bus) 

Number of ways to take 4 buses from N to O = 4 

Number of ways to take 1 bus from O to P = 1 

Number of ways to take 3 buses from P to Q = 3 

Therefore, the total number of ways to travel from M to Q is: 

3 x 4 x 1 x 3 = 36

120 - 96 = 24 

Next, we need to find what percentage of the original value the difference represents: 

(24/120) x 100% = 20%

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to simplify the expression inside the brackets:

5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = ? × 19 - 17

Next, we need to simplify the expression in the denominator:

13 × 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13

Now we can substitute these simplified expressions into the original equation:

[? × 19 - 17]/13 = 6

Multiplying both sides by 13, we get:

? × 19 - 17 = 78

Adding 17 to both sides, we get:

? × 19 = 95

Dividing both sides by 19, we get:

? = 5

How many students are there in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 850 (B) 800 (C) 900 (D) 950 (E) 1000
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 20 students are not interested in any games. Let's subtract them from the total number of students in the class.

Let's call the total number of students "x". So, we have:

x - 20 = total number of students interested in at least one game

Next, we can use the information given about the percentages of students interested in each game to set up equations.

We know that 8% of students are interested in football, so:

0.08x = number of students interested in football

We also know that 4/5 (or 80%) of students are interested in cricket, so:

0.8x = number of students interested in cricket

And finally, we know that 10% of students are interested in basketball, so:

0.1x = number of students interested in basketball

Now we can use these equations to solve for x. We'll start by adding up the number of students interested in each game:

number of students interested in at least one game = number of students interested in football + number of students interested in cricket + number of students interested in basketball

Substituting in the equations we set up earlier, we get:

5265526 - 4169516 = 1096010

So there are 1096010 children in the city. However, none of the answer choices match this exact number. The closest answer choice is (A) 1095961, which is only off by 49. This could be due to rounding or a slight error in the calculation. Therefore, the answer is (A) 1095961.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle, which is given by the formula P = 2(l + b), where l is the length and b is the breadth. 

So, P = 2(27 + 17) = 88 cm 

Since the wire is rebent to form a square, the perimeter of the square will be the same as the perimeter of the rectangle. 

Therefore, the perimeter of the square will also be 88 cm. 

The formula for the perimeter of a square is P = 4s, where s is the length of each side. 

So, 4s = 88 

Dividing both sides by 4, we get s = 22 

Therefore, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm. 

Hence, the answer is (C) 22.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. This means that 0.4 gallons of the soft drink is orange juice and 0.6 gallons is water.

Now, we want to add more orange juice to make it 60% of the soft drink. Let's say we add x gallons of orange juice.

After adding x gallons of orange juice, the total volume of the soft drink will be 1 + x gallons.

The new percentage of orange juice in the soft drink will be (0.4 + x) / (1 + x) * 100%.

We want this to be 60%, so we can set up the equation:

(0.4 + x) / (1 + x) * 100% = 60%

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x

0.4 - 0.6 = 0.6x - x

-0.2 = 0.4x

x = -0.2 / 0.4

A: Let's think step by step. Let the marked price of the watch be x.

When the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, he earns a profit, let's say, y.

So, the selling price of the watch after a 5% discount would be (x - 0.05x) = 0.95x.

Therefore, y = 0.95x - x = -0.05x.

Now, when the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, he earns a profit of y - 15.

So, the selling price of the watch after a 7% discount would be (x - 0.07x) = 0.93x.

Therefore, y - 15 = 0.93x - x = -0.07x - 15.

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0.02x = 15

x = 750

Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much commission the servant will earn on the monthly sale. We know that the commission is 15% of the monthly sale, so we can write:

Commission = 0.15 x Monthly Sale

Next, we need to find out what the monthly sale should be in order for the servant to earn a total income of 6000. We can write:

Total Income = Monthly Salary + Commission
6000 = 1500 + 0.15 x Monthly Sale

Now we can solve for Monthly Sale:

0.15 x Monthly Sale = 4500
Monthly Sale = 4500 / 0.15
Monthly Sale = 30,000

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Let's assume that the speed of the ship is x miles per hour. 

After traveling for 180 miles, the ship has covered a distance of 180 miles. 

Now, the plane starts with a speed of 10x miles per hour. 

Let's assume that they meet after t hours. 

Distance covered by the ship in t hours = x * t 

Distance covered by the plane in t hours = 10x * t 

As they meet, the distance covered by both of them is the same. 

Therefore, we can write the equation: 

x * t = 180 + 10x * t 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

180 = 9x * t 

t = 180 / 9x 

Now, we can find the distance covered by the plane in t hours: 

Distance covered by the plane = 10x * t 

Substituting the value of t, we get: 

Distance covered by the plane = 10x * (180 / 9x) = 200 miles 

Therefore, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 180 + 200 = 380 miles.

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use algebra to represent the problem. Let x be the original price of the item. 

After a 22% discount, the item costs 0.78x. 

Then, the customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the final price paid is 0.78x - 20. 

We know that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so we can set up the equation: 

0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

0.28x = 21.90 

x = 78.20

Now, we need to figure out how many students were surveyed. Since each student selected 2 songs, we can divide the total number of selections by 2 to get the number of students:

50 total selections / 2 selections per student = 25 students

Therefore, the answer is (D) 25.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the bus fare of one child. We know that the fare of one child is half the fare of one adult. So, the fare of one child is Rs. 140/2 = Rs. 70.

Next, we need to find the total bus fare of 4 adults and 3 children. The total fare for 4 adults is 4 x Rs. 140 = Rs. 560. The total fare for 3 children is 3 x Rs. 70 = Rs. 210.

Therefore, the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children is Rs. 560 + Rs. 210 = Rs. 770.

Q: Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which Answer Choices: (A) L (x,y)  = R (x,y)  (B) L (x,y)  ≠ R (x,y)  (C) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (D) L (x,y)  < R (x,y)  (E) None
A: Let's think step by step. First, let's simplify L(x,y) and R(x,y) using the definition of greatest integer function:

L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] = x + y + [x + y] - {fractional part of x} - {fractional part of y}

R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = 2x + 2y - {fractional part of 2x} - {fractional part of 2y}

Now, we can see that L(x,y) and R(x,y) differ by the fractional parts of x and y. Since x and y are positive real numbers, their fractional parts are always less than 1. Therefore, it is impossible for L(x,y) to be equal to R(x,y) or less than R(x,y). The only possible answer choice is (B) L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y). 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y).

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let the selling price of the sewing machine be x.

Karan wants to make a 20% profit on the cost price of the sewing machine, which is Rs. 1200/-. Therefore, the selling price should be:

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
x = 1200 + 0.2*1200
x = 1200 + 240
x = 1440

Now, Karan wants to offer a 20% discount on the selling price. Therefore, the discounted selling price should be:

Discounted selling price = Selling price - Discount
Discounted selling price = 1440 - 0.2*1440
Discounted selling price = 1440 - 288
Discounted selling price = 1152

We know that the discounted selling price should be equal to x, the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine. Therefore:

x = 1152

Hence, the answer is (E) 1,800.

Answer Choices: (A) 126 (B) 77 (C) 88 (D) 66 (E) 54
A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume that the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is x. 

According to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds of the train fare for one person. Therefore, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)x. 

Now, let's calculate the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus. Since each bus fare is for two persons, we can say that the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is (6/2) * (4/3)x = 4x. 

Similarly, let's calculate the total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train. The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8x. 

According to the problem, the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is Rs.1512. Therefore, we can write the equation: 

4x + 8x = 1512 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

12x = 1512 

x = 126 

Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs.126. 

Hence, the answer is (A) 126.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total amount paid back by the man over the 12 monthly installments. 

Total amount paid back = 12 x Rs.31.50 = Rs.378

Next, we need to find the interest charged on the loan. 

Interest charged = Total amount paid back - Amount borrowed 
Interest charged = Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18

Finally, we can calculate the interest rate using the formula: 

Interest rate = (Interest charged / Amount borrowed) x 100%

Interest rate = (Rs.18 / Rs.360) x 100% = 5%

Therefore, the answer is (D) 5%.

A: Let's think step by step. Let's assume the man's monthly income is x.

He spends Rs. 3500 per month, so his savings will be x - 3500.

He saves 12 1/2% of his income, which can be written as 1/8.

So, we can write the equation as:

x - 3500 = (1/8)x

Multiplying both sides by 8, we get:

8x - 28000 = x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

7x = 28000

x = 4000

Therefore, the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000.

Hence, the answer is (C) Rs. 4000.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume that there are 'x' number of 25 paise coins, 'x' number of 50 paise coins and 'x' number of one rupee coins.

So, the total amount of money in the pouch can be calculated as follows:

Total amount = (25/100)x + (50/100)x + 1x
Total amount = (0.25)x + (0.5)x + 1x
Total amount = 1.75x

Now, we know that the total amount in the pouch is Rs. 700. So, we can equate the above equation to 700 and solve for 'x'.

1.75x = 700
x = 400

Therefore, there are 400 coins of each denomination in the pouch. 

Hence, the answer is (C) 400.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can simplify the expression in the numerator by using the identity (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. 

n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16 = n^2 + 2n√(n+4) + 4(n+4) 

Next, we can simplify the expression in the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by (n-4√n+4). 

n+4√n+4 = (n+4√n+4) * (n-4√n+4) / (n-4√n+4) = n^2 - 16 

Now, we can substitute these simplified expressions into the original expression for x: 

x = (n^2 + 2n√(n+4) + 4(n+4)) / (n^2 - 16) 

We can simplify this expression further by factoring the numerator: 

x = [(n+2√(n+4))^2] / [(n+4)(n-4)] 

Since 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, we know that 8 ≤

A: Let's think step by step. We know that A and B are independent events, which means that the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other event. Therefore, we can use the formula:

P(A/B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

We know that P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. We also know that A and B are independent events, so:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A) x P(B) = 0.2 x 0.8 = 0.16

Now we can substitute these values into the formula:

P(A/B) = 0.16 / 0.8 = 0.2

Therefore, the answer is (A) 0.2.

A: Let's think step by step. We know that one of the roots of the quadratic equation is 1.5. This means that when we substitute x = 1.5 into the equation, we get a value of 0. 

So, we can write:

(1.5)^2 + m(1.5) + 22 = 0

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2.25 + 1.5m + 22 = 0

23.25 + 1.5m = 0

1.5m = -23.25

m = -23.25/1.5

m = -15.5

Therefore, the value of m is -15.5, which is not one of the answer choices. However, we made a mistake in our calculations. 

Let's go back to the equation:

2.25 + 1.5m + 22 = 0

23.25 + 1.5m = 0

1.5m = -23.25 - 22

1.5m = -45.25

m = -45.25/1.5

m = -30.1666667

Rounding to one decimal place, we get m

If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? Answer Choices: (A) 43 seconds (B) 39 seconds (C) 20 seconds (D) 33 seconds (E) 55 seconds
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from miles per hour to miles per second, since we are given the time in seconds. 

120 miles per hour = 120/60 = 2 miles per minute
2 miles per minute = 2/60 = 1/30 miles per second

Next, we need to find out how far the train travels in three seconds, which is the time it takes to enter the tunnel. 

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = (1/30) x 3
Distance = 1/10 mile

Now we know that the train travels 1/10 mile to enter the tunnel. To find out how long it takes to pass completely through the tunnel, we need to add the length of the tunnel to the distance traveled. 

Total distance = 1 mile + 1/10 mile
Total distance = 11/10 miles

Finally, we can use the formula Distance = Speed x Time again to find the time it takes to travel the total distance. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = (11/10) / (1/30)
Time = 33 seconds

Therefore, the answer is (D) 33 seconds.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find the difference between the astronaut's weight on Earth and Venus:

211 - 182 = 29

This means that the astronaut weighs 29 pounds less on Venus than on Earth.

Next, we need to find what percentage of the astronaut's weight on Earth is 29 pounds:

(29/211) x 100% = 13.74%

So, the weight of the astronaut on Venus is approximately 13.74% of the astronaut's weight on Earth.

Finally, we need to round this percentage to the nearest answer choice:

Next, we need to find the number of ways he can choose a vegetable for dinner. Since he has 8 different types of vegetables, he can choose one of them in 8 ways.

To find the total number of ways he can eat breakfast and dinner, we need to multiply the number of ways he can choose a fruit for breakfast by the number of ways he can choose a vegetable for dinner. Therefore, the total number of ways is 6 x 8 = 48.

And Peter dutifully performs the calculations, then marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer. What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating? Answer Choices: (A) 1/18 (B) 1/9 (C) 23/90 (D) 5/18 (E) 13/45
A: Let's think step by step. The probability that Alan answers correctly is 1/5, and the probability that Roger cheats and answers correctly is 2/3. The probability that Peter answers correctly is 5/6. 

To find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, we need to subtract the probability that Roger cheats and answers correctly from the total probability of answering correctly. 

So, the total probability of answering correctly is:

1/5 (Alan) + 2/3 (Roger cheats) + 5/6 (Peter) 

= 6/30 + 10/30 + 25/30 

= 41/30 

Now, we need to subtract the probability that Roger cheats and answers correctly. The probability that Roger cheats and answers correctly is:

2/3 (Roger cheats) * 1/2 (probability that the student in front of him answered correctly) 

= 1/3 

So, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is:

41/30 - 1/3 

= (123 - 10)/90 

= 113/90

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the rate at which each person works. A can construct a wall in 40 minutes, so his rate is 1/40 of the wall per minute. Similarly, B's rate is 1/45 of the wall per minute.

When they work together, their rates add up. So, the combined rate is:

1/40 + 1/45 = 9/360 + 8/360 = 17/360

This means that together, they can construct 17/360 of the wall per minute.

To find out how long it will take them to construct the entire wall, we need to divide the total work (1 wall) by their combined rate:

1 / (17/360) = 360/17 minutes

This is approximately equal to 21.18 minutes, which is closest to answer choice (D) 21 min.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we need to figure out how much the grocer paid for each bag of flour. We know that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, so we can set up an equation:

Selling price = Cost price + Profit
$100 = Cost price + 25% of selling price

We can simplify this equation by converting 25% to a decimal:

$100 = Cost price + 0.25($100)
$100 = Cost price + $25
Cost price = $75

So the grocer paid $75 for each bag of flour.

Next, we need to figure out how many bags the grocer sold. We know that the grocer made $3,000 in profit, so we can set up another equation:

Profit = Profit per bag x Number of bags sold
$3,000 = 25% of selling price x Number of bags sold

Again, we can simplify this equation by converting 25% to a decimal:

$3,000 = 0.25($100) x Number of bags sold
$3,000 = $25 x Number of bags sold
Number of bags sold = $3,000 / $25
 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 30. The grocer sold 30 bags of flour.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per minute, since we want to find the time in minutes. 

To do this, we can divide 12 by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour): 

12 miles/hour ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 0.2 miles/minute 

This means the cyclist travels 0.2 miles every minute. 

Next, we can use the formula: 

time = distance ÷ speed 

We want to find the time it takes to travel 48 miles, so: 

time = 48 miles ÷ 0.2 miles/minute 

time = 240 minutes 

Therefore, the answer is (B) 240.

Q: Sharon works for 5 hours to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake, while Karen works for 4. After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour (B) 2 hours (C) 3 hours (D) 4 hours (E) 5 hours
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much each person earns per hour. We can do this by dividing the total amount earned by the number of hours worked. 

For Sharon: 
Total amount earned = cost of ice cream cake 
Number of hours worked = 5 
So, amount earned per hour = cost of ice cream cake / 5 

For Karen: 
Total amount earned = cost of ice cream cake 
Number of hours worked = 4 
So, amount earned per hour = cost of ice cream cake / 4 

Now, we can add the amount earned per hour by Sharon and Karen to find out how much they earn together per hour: 

Amount earned per hour together = (cost of ice cream cake / 5) + (cost of ice cream cake / 4) 

We can simplify this expression by finding a common denominator: 

Amount earned per hour together = (4 * cost of ice cream cake / 20) + (5 * cost of ice cream cake / 20) 

Amount earned per hour together = (9 * cost of ice cream cake / 20) 

Now, we can set up an equation to find out how many hours it will take for them to earn enough to buy the ice cream cake together: 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 3 hours.

Q: Printer A and Printer B can each print 1⁄2 page per second. How long will it take both printers working together to print 100 pages? Answer Choices: (A) 25 seconds (B) 50 seconds (C) 100 seconds (D) 200 seconds (E) 400 seconds
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that Printer A can print 1/2 page per second and Printer B can also print 1/2 page per second. 

So, together they can print 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 page per second. 

To print 100 pages, we need to divide 100 by the rate at which they can print together, which is 1 page per second. 

Therefore, it will take 100/1 = 100 seconds for both printers working together to print 100 pages. 

So, the answer is (C) 100 seconds. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 100 seconds.

Q: The price of a product is reduced by 30% . By what percentage should it be increased to make it 100% Answer Choices: (A) 41.86% (B) 42.86% (C) 43.86% (D) 44.86% (E) 45.86%
A: Let's think step by step. If the price of a product is reduced by 30%, it means that the new price is 70% of the original price. 

Let's say the original price is $100. After the 30% reduction, the new price would be:

$100 x 0.7 = $70

To make the price 100% again, we need to increase it by the amount that was reduced, which is 30%. 

So, we need to find out what percentage of $70 is 30. 

30 / 70 = 0.4286

Therefore, the percentage increase needed to make the price 100% is 42.86%, which is answer choice (B). 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 42.86%.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find 30% of 1400 grams. 

30% of 1400 = (30/100) x 1400 = 420 grams 

Next, we need to find 60% of 420 grams. 

60% of 420 = (60/100) x 420 = 252 grams 

Therefore, the answer is (C) 252 gms.

Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the total number of steps in the staircase. Let's call this number "S". 

Next, we can use the information given to set up two equations: 

20(S-x) = 10S 

10(S-2x) = S 

where "x" is the number of steps the elevator moves in one minute. 

Simplifying these equations, we get: 

20S - 20xS = 10S 

10S - 20x = S 

Solving for S in the second equation, we get: 

S = 20x 

Substituting this into the first equation, we get: 

20(20x - x) = 10(20x) 

380x = 200x 

x = 1/2 

Therefore, the elevator moves 1/2 step per minute, which is equivalent to 30 steps per hour.

A: Let's think step by step. Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him. He already has 10 friends who would like to participate. So, he needs to choose 10 people from the remaining group of people.

The number of ways to choose 10 people from a group of n people is given by the combination formula:

nC10 = n! / (10! * (n-10)!)

Here, n = number of people who are not Peter's friends and want to participate in the scavenger hunt.

Since we don't know the value of n, we cannot calculate the exact number of choices Peter has for forming his team. However, we can eliminate some answer choices based on common sense.

Option (A) 0 is not possible because Peter has 10 friends who want to participate.

Option (B) 1 is also not possible because there are likely to be more than one way to choose 10 people from a group of n people.

Option (E) 4 is also unlikely because the number of people who want to participate is not likely to be a small number.

Therefore, the answer is either (C) 2 or (D) 3. We cannot determine the exact answer without knowing the value of n. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is either (C) 2 or (D) 3.

Q: A train running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, takes 10 hours to reach its destination. After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 13.5 (E) 15
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total distance the train travels. We know that it takes 10 hours to reach its destination at a speed of 100 miles/hour, so:

distance = speed x time
distance = 100 x 10
distance = 1000 miles

Next, we need to find the distance the train travels before it starts raining. We know that it covers a quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour, so:

distance before raining = 1/4 x 1000
distance before raining = 250 miles

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the train to travel the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour. Let's call this time "t".

distance after raining = 1000 - 250
distance after raining = 750 miles

time = distance / speed
t = 750 / 75
t = 10 hours

So, the total journey duration is:

total time = time before raining + time after raining
total time = 250 / 100 + 10
total time = 2.5 + 10
total time = 12.5 hours

Therefore, the answer is (C) 12.5.

Q: It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour. How many minutes will it take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour? Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the distance between home and work. We can use the formula distance = rate x time, where rate is in kilometers per hour and time is in hours. 

For the worker driving, we know that the rate is 20 kilometers per hour and the time is 9 minutes, which is 9/60 = 0.15 hours. So the distance is:

distance = rate x time
distance = 20 km/h x 0.15 h
distance = 3 km

Now we can use the same formula to find the time it takes for the worker to cycle at a rate of 6 kilometers per hour:

distance = rate x time
3 km = 6 km/h x time
time = 3 km / 6 km/h
time = 0.5 hours

But we want the answer in minutes, so we need to convert 0.5 hours to minutes:

time = 0.5 hours x 60 minutes/hour
time = 30 minutes

Therefore, the answer is (A) 30. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 30.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total width of all the pickets. Since there are x pickets and each is 1/2 inch wide, the total width of all the pickets is x/2 inches.

Next, we need to find the total width of all the spaces between the pickets. There are x-1 spaces between the pickets, and each space is 6 inches wide. So the total width of all the spaces is 6(x-1) inches.

Finally, we add the width of the pickets and the spaces together to get the total length of the fence. We need to convert the total length from inches to feet, so we divide by 12. Therefore, the length of the fence in feet is:

x/2 + 6(x-1)/12 = x/2 + (x-1)/2 = (3x-2)/2

Now we need to simplify this expression to match one of the answer choices. We can rewrite (3x-2)/2 as (13x-12)/24, so the answer is (E) (13x-12)/24. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) (13x-12)/24.

A: Let's think step by step. There are a total of 5 horses in the race, so there are 5C2 ways to select any two horses out of the five. 

Out of these 5C2 ways, there is only one way to select the winning horse. 

Therefore, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is 1/5C2.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. This means that the percentage of students who are only in the chess club is 100% - 24% = 76%. Similarly, the percentage of students who are only in the swim team is 100% - 24% = 76%.

Next, we are told that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means that 80% of members of the swim team are also members of the chess club. 

To find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, we need to add the percentage of students who are only in the swim team to the percentage of students who are in both the chess club and the swim team. 

The percentage of students who are only in the swim team is 76% x (unknown percentage) = 76% x (1 - 0.24) = 57.76%. 

The percentage of students who are in both the chess club and the swim team is 24%. 

Therefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is 57.76% + 24% =  
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not provided. We need to calculate it using the above steps. 

The percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is 57.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we have 6 books to arrange. We can start by choosing one book to put on the left end of the shelf. We have 6 choices for this. 

Next, we choose another book to put next to the first one. We have 5 choices left for this. 

Continuing this process, we have 4 choices for the third book, 3 choices for the fourth book, 2 choices for the fifth book, and only 1 choice for the last book. 

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the books is:

6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We need to form a bike number using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. 

To find the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to find the number of possible combinations of letters and numbers.

For the first letter, we have 26 options (A-Z). For the second letter, we also have 26 options. So, the total number of options for the two letters is 26 x 26 = 676.

For the first number, we have 10 options (0-9). For the second number, we also have 10 options. So, the total number of options for the two numbers is 10 x 10 = 100.

To find the total number of distinct bike numbers, we need to multiply the number of options for the letters and the numbers. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers is 676 x 100 = 67,600.

We don't need to worry about the letters being distinct, as the problem doesn't specify that. So, the answer is (D) 65,000.

The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? Answer Choices: (A) 1.3 (B) 1.5 (C) 2.1 (D) 2.5 (E) 3.1
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out what percentage of the revenue came from the sale of biographies. We know that 34% of the revenue came from the sale of novels, so the remaining percentage is:

100% - 34% = 66%

Next, we know that 1/3 of this remaining revenue came from the sale of biographies. To find out what percentage this is, we can divide 66% by 3:

66% ÷ 3 = 22%

So, 22% of the revenue came from the sale of biographies. 

Now, we need to compare the revenue from the sale of novels to the revenue from the sale of biographies. We can do this by dividing the percentage of revenue from novels by the percentage of revenue from biographies:

34% ÷ 22% = 1.54

So, the revenue from the sale of novels was approximately 1.54 times the revenue from the sale of biographies. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) 1.5.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we need to figure out how many inches on the map represent one mile in real life. We know that 1/4 inch represents 10 miles, so we can set up a proportion:

1/4 inch = 10 miles
x inches = 1 mile

Cross-multiplying, we get:

1/4 * 1 = 10 * x
x = 1/40 inch

So, one mile in real life is represented by 1/40 inch on the map.

Next, we need to figure out how many miles the 20-inch road on the map represents in real life. We can set up another proportion:

1/40 inch = 1 mile
20 inches = y miles

Cross-multiplying, we get:

1/40 * y = 20
y = 800

So, the actual distance from Town F to Town G along this road is 800 miles. Therefore, the answer is (A) 800.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 6 pita breads = 2 rolls in terms of falafel amount. Therefore, 1 roll = 3 pita breads in terms of falafel amount.

Next, we know that 3 rolls = 5 baguettes in terms of falafel amount. Using the conversion we just found, we can substitute 3 rolls with 9 pita breads (since 3 rolls = 9 pita breads) and 5 baguettes with 15 pita breads (since 5 baguettes = 15 pita breads). Therefore, we have:

9 pita breads = 15 pita breads
2 rolls = 5 baguettes
3 pita breads = 1 roll

Now we can solve for how many pita breads are equivalent to 2 baguettes. We can start by using the conversion 2 rolls = 5 baguettes and substituting 1 roll with 3 pita breads:

2 rolls = 5 baguettes
1 roll = 3 pita breads

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

2 rolls = 5 baguettes
2 rolls =

Q: Shweta rides at the rate of 10 km per hour but stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. How many hours will she take to cover 100 km Answer Choices: (A) 9 hours. (B) 10 hours. (C) 11 hours. (D) 12 hours. (E) 13 hours.
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Shweta rides at a rate of 10 km per hour, which means she covers 10 km in one hour.

However, she stops for 10 minutes to take rest at the end of every 15 km. This means that after every 15 km, she takes a break of 10 minutes.

To cover 100 km, she will have to take 6 breaks (since 15 km x 6 = 90 km). This means she will take a total of 60 minutes or 1 hour in breaks.

So, the total time she will take to cover 100 km will be:

Time taken to cover 100 km = (Distance covered ÷ Speed) + Total break time

= (100 km ÷ 10 km/hour) + 1 hour (total break time)

= 10 hours + 1 hour

= 11 hours

Therefore, the answer is (C) 11 hours. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 11 hours.

We know that Sachin's current batting average is 51. This means that in all the matches he has played so far, he has scored a total of X runs divided by Y innings, where Y is the number of times he has been dismissed.

Let's say he has played Z matches so far. Then, we can write an equation:

X/Z = 51

Now, we know that in the finals, Sachin scored 78 runs and his new batting average is 54. This means that his total runs scored in the season is now X + 78, and his total innings played is now Y + 1.

We can write another equation:

(X + 78)/(Z + 1) = 54

We have two equations and two unknowns (X and Z). We can solve for them using algebra.

First, we can simplify the second equation:

X + 78 = 54(Z + 1)

X + 78 = 54Z + 54

X = 54Z - 24

Now, we can substitute this expression for X into the first equation:

(54Z - 24)/Z = 51

54Z - 24 = 51Z 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 10.

Q: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12
A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that Jack bought x white sharpeners and y brown sharpeners. 

We know that he bought a total of 18 sharpeners, so we can write an equation: 

x + y = 18 

We also know that he paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. So, if we let the cost of a brown sharpener be z rupees, then the cost of a white sharpener would be z + 1 rupees. 

The total cost of all the sharpeners was 100 rupees, so we can write another equation: 

y*z + x*(z+1) = 100 

Now we have two equations with two variables. We can solve for one variable in terms of the other in the first equation: 

x = 18 - y 

Then we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation: 

y*z + (18-y)*(z+1) = 100 

Expanding and simplifying: 

y*z + 18*z + 18 - y*z - y = 100 

17*z - y = 82 

Now we have one equation with one variable. We can try different values of y (keeping in mind that 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is B) 9,8. 

If y = 8, then x = 18 - y = 10. 

Then the total cost equation becomes
pred_before :  B) 9,8. 

If y = 8, then x = 18 - y = 10. 

Then the total cost equation becomes

Q: If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue? Answer Choices: (A) $7.73 (B) $6.73 (C) $5.73 (D) $4.73 (E) $3.73
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that the subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00. 

Next, we know that this subscription represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. 

To find the cover price per issue, we can use the following formula: 

Cover price per issue = (Subscription cost / Number of issues) / (1 - Discount rate)

Plugging in the values we know, we get: 

Cover price per issue = ($42.00 / 15) / (1 - 0.25) 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

Cover price per issue = $2.80 / 0.75 

Cover price per issue = $3.73 

Therefore, the answer is (E) $3.73. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) $3.73.

Q: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is: Answer Choices: (A) 15 kmph (B) 6 kmph (C) 12 kmph (D) 14 kmph (E) 6 kmph
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let the rate of the current be x kmph.

Then, the rate of the man downstream (along the current) = rate in still water + rate of current = 4 + x kmph.

And, the rate of the man upstream (against the current) = rate in still water - rate of current = 4 - x kmph.

Given, the rate upstream = 2 kmph.

So, 4 - x = 2.

Solving for x, we get x = 2 kmph.

Now, the rate downstream = 4 + 2 = 6 kmph.

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is 6 kmph.

Hence, the answer is (E) 6 kmph. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 6 kmph.

Q: On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is: Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 11 (C) 12 (D) 13 (E) 14
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the common remainder when 2272 and 875 are divided by N. Let's call this remainder "r". 

So, we have: 

2272 ≡ r (mod N) 

875 ≡ r (mod N) 

To find the value of N, we can use the fact that N divides the difference between 2272 and 875 (since they have the same remainder when divided by N). 

So, we have: 

2272 - 875 = 1397 = kN 

where k is some integer. 

Now, we need to find a 3-digit factor of 1397. We can do this by trial and error, or we can use divisibility rules. 

The sum of the digits of 1397 is 20, which is not one of the answer choices. However, we can simplify 1397 by dividing by 7 (since 7 divides 1400). 

1397 ÷ 7 = 199 

The sum of the digits of 199 is 19, which is still not one of the answer choices. However, we can simplify further by dividing by 19. 

199 ÷ 19 = 10 remainder 9 

So, 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 10, since the sum of the digits of the factor N is 10.
pred_before :  (A) 10, since the sum of the digits of the factor N is 10.

Q: There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well? Answer Choices: (A) 25 days (B) 26 days (C) 27 days (D) 28 days (E) 29 days
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

On the first day, the frog jumps 3m up and falls back 2m down, so it makes a net progress of 1m.

On the second day, the frog jumps 3m up and falls back 2m down again, so it makes another net progress of 1m.

We can see that the frog makes a net progress of 1m every day. To get out of the well, the frog needs to make a total progress of 30m (the depth of the well).

Therefore, the frog will need 30 days to get out of the well, since it makes a net progress of 1m every day.

So the answer is not one of the choices given. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is none of the above.

Q: A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article? Answer Choices: (A) 270 (B) 300 (C) 280 (D) 320 (E) 315
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume the cost price of the article is x.

According to the problem, the trader sold the article at a profit of 20%. 

Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price

Profit% = (Profit/Cost Price) x 100

So, Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit

Selling Price = x + 20% of x = x + 0.2x = 1.2x

Given, Selling Price = Rs.360

So, 1.2x = 360

x = 360/1.2

x = 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

Hence, the answer is (B) 300. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 300.

Q: If the population of a city increases by 5 % annually, what will be the population of the city in 2 years time if its current population is 78000? Answer Choices: (A) 81900 (B) 85995 (C) 85800 (D) 90000 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that the population of the city is currently 78000. 

We also know that the population increases by 5% annually. 

So, to find the population in 1 year, we can multiply the current population by 1.05 (since 5% is equivalent to multiplying by 1.05). 

Therefore, the population in 1 year will be:

78000 x 1.05 = 81900 

To find the population in 2 years, we can repeat the process and multiply the population in 1 year by 1.05 again. 

So, the population in 2 years will be:

81900 x 1.05 = 85995 

Therefore, the answer is (B) 85995. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 85995.

Q: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. Answer Choices: (A) 144km (B) 72 km (C) 126km (D) 84 km (E) 48km
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Let's assume the distance between X and Y is "d" km.

When Allen reaches Y and changes his direction, he has covered a distance of d/2 km.

Similarly, when Bob reaches X and changes his direction, he has also covered a distance of d/2 km.

Let's say they meet for the first time after "t" hours.

In "t" hours, Allen covers a distance of 54t km and Bob covers a distance of 78t km.

When they meet for the first time, the total distance covered by both of them is d/2 km.

So, we can write the equation:

54t + 78t = d/2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

132t = d/2

t = d/264

Now, let's say they meet for the second time after "t2" hours.

In "t2" hours, Allen covers a distance of 54t2 km and Bob covers a distance of 78t2 km.

We know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time.

So, we can write the equation:

78t2 = 54t2 + 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 84 km.

Q: The manufacturer of tyres is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. Some retailers are offering additional discounts. If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then what is the total discount available at that retailer? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 25% (C) 28% (D) 30% (E) 36%
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the discount offered by the manufacturer, which is 20%. 

Next, we need to calculate the discount offered by the retailer, which is an additional 20% off the discounted price. 

To calculate the total discount, we need to multiply the two discounts together. 

So, the total discount is:

20% x 20% = 4%

Therefore, the total discount available at that retailer is 20% + 4% = 24%, which is closest to answer choice (B) 25%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 25%.

Q: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? Answer Choices: (A) $50000 (B) $40000 (C) $30000 (D) $20000 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that the monthly salary S of the shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. So we can write an equation:

S = 500 + 0.05x

where x is the monthly sales.

We also know that we want the monthly salary to reach $1500. So we can set up another equation:

S = 1500

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

500 + 0.05x = 1500

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0.05x = 1000

Dividing both sides by 0.05, we get:

x = 20000

So the monthly sales should be $20,000 for the shop assistant to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

Therefore, the answer is (D) $20,000. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) $20,000.

Q: What is the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made out of 28 white and 98 red tulips if no flowers are to be left out? (Two bouquets are identical whenever the number of red tulips in the two bouquets is equal and the number of white tulips in the two bouquets is equal.) Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 7 (C) 10 (D) 14 (E) 21
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 28 and 98 to determine the maximum number of bouquets that can be made with an equal number of red and white tulips. 

The prime factorization of 28 is 2 x 2 x 7, and the prime factorization of 98 is 2 x 7 x 7. 

The GCF of 28 and 98 is 2 x 7, which is 14. 

Therefore, we can make a maximum of 14 identical bouquets with 14 red tulips and 14 white tulips in each bouquet. 

To check, we can see that 14 x 2 = 28 and 14 x 7 = 98. 

Therefore, the answer is (D) 14. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 14.

Q: If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. Then, find the number? Answer Choices: (A) 84 (B) 66 (C) 28 (D) 19 (E) 11
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We are given that one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. 

Let's represent the number as "x". 

So, we can write the equation as:

(1/3) * (3/4) * x = 21 

Simplifying this equation, we get:

(1/4) * x = 21 

Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:

x = 84 

Therefore, the answer is (A) 84. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 84.

Q: A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain? Answer Choices: (A) y/ (1200xy)  (B) 20xy/w (C) 5xy/ (12w)  (D) w/ (3xy)  (E) 3y/ (wx) 
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many gallons pass through the drain in one second. We can do this by dividing the rate by the time:

w/25 gallons every x seconds = w/25x gallons per second

Next, we need to find out how many seconds it will take to pass y gallons. We can do this by setting up a proportion:

w/25x = y/t

where t is the time in seconds. Solving for t, we get:

t = 25xy/w

Finally, we need to convert the time to minutes. There are 60 seconds in one minute, so:

t = 25xy/w * 1/60 = 5xy/ (12w)

Therefore, the answer is (C) 5xy/ (12w). 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 5xy/ (12w).
pred_before :  (C) 5xy/ (12w).

Q: At an election meeting 10 speakers are to address the meeting. The only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak the pm should speak before the mp and the mp should speak before the mla. In how many ways can the meeting be held? Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose who will speak first. There are 10 options for this. Let's say the chosen person is the PM.

Next, we need to choose who will speak second. There are 9 options left, but we know that the MP must speak after the PM, so there is only 1 option for this.

Similarly, there is only 1 option for who will speak third (the MLA).

For the fourth speaker, there are 7 options left (since the PM, MP, and MLA have already spoken), but we know that the PM must speak before the MP, so there are only 3 options for this.

For the fifth speaker, there are 6 options left, but we know that the MP must speak before the MLA, so there are only 2 options for this.

For the sixth speaker, there are 4 options left (since the PM, MP, MLA, and the previous speaker have already spoken), but we know that the PM must speak before the MP, so there are only 2 options for this.

For the seventh speaker, there are 3 options left, but we know that the MP must speak before the MLA, so there is only 1 option for this.

For the eighth speaker, there

Q: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? Answer Choices: (A) 126km (B) 144km (C) 127km (D) 228km (E) 128km
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume that the distance travelled by the jeep is "d" km.

During the forward journey, the jeep took 6 hours to travel the distance "d" km. Therefore, the speed of the jeep during the forward journey is:

Speed = Distance / Time = d / 6 km/hr

During the return journey, the speed of the jeep increased by 12 km/hr. Therefore, the speed of the jeep during the return journey is:

Speed = (d / 4) + 12 km/hr

We know that the distance travelled during the forward journey is the same as the distance travelled during the return journey. Therefore, we can equate the distance travelled during the forward journey to the distance travelled during the return journey.

d = Speed during forward journey x Time taken during forward journey

d = (d / 6) x 6

d = d km

d = Speed during return journey x Time taken during return journey

d = [(d / 4) + 12] x 4

d = (d + 48) km

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

d - d = 48

0 = 48

This is not possible

Q: 8 man work for 6 days to complete a work. How many men are required to complete same work in 1/2 day. Answer Choices: (A) 93 men (B) 94 men (C) 95 men (D) 96 men (E) 97 men
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total amount of work that needs to be done. We know that 8 men can complete the work in 6 days, so we can use the formula:

work = rate x time

where rate is the amount of work done per unit of time. In this case, the rate is 8 men working for 6 days, so:

work = 8 x 6 = 48 man-days

This means that 48 man-days of work need to be done to complete the job.

Next, we need to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. We can use the same formula, but this time we know the time (1/2 day) and we want to find the rate (number of men needed). So:

rate = work / time

rate = 48 / (1/2)

rate = 96

Therefore, the answer is (D) 96 men. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 96 men.
pred_before :  (D) 96 men.

Q: The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now? Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 30 (C) 6 (D) 15 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5:3. This means that the new length of the ribbon is 5/3 times smaller than the original length.

To find the new length, we can multiply the original length by the ratio 5/3:

New length = 30 cm x 5/3
New length = 50 cm/3

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 1:

New length = 50/3 cm

This is the final answer. However, it is not one of the answer choices given. We need to choose the closest answer choice to this value.

The closest answer choice is (E) 12 cm. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 12.

Q: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. Answer Choices: (A) 20 (B) 30 (C) 40 (D) 200 (E) None
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that M is a three-digit number, so we can write it as M = 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, N = 100c + 10b + a.

Since M > N, we have 100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a, which simplifies to 99a > 99c or a > c.

Now we can substitute M and N into the equation M - N + 396c = 990 and simplify:

(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990
99a - 99c + 397c = 990
99(a - c) = 990 - 397c
a - c = (990 - 397c)/99

Since a > c, we know that a - c is a positive integer. Therefore, (990 - 397c)/99 must be a positive integer as well. This means that 990 - 397c is a multiple of 99, or 990 - 397c = 99k for some integer k.

Simplifying this equation, we get:

c = 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 40. 

To see why, we need to find how many values of M are more than 300. Since M is a three-digit number

Q: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number. Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the sum of the digits is 17. This means that the hundreds digit plus the tens digit plus the units digit equals 17. We can write this as:

h + t + u = 17

Next, we know that the sum of the squares of the digits is 109. This means that:

h^2 + t^2 + u^2 = 109

We also know that if we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number with the same digits in reverse order. Let's call the original number "abc". Then:

abc - 495 = cba

We can rewrite this as:

100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a

Simplifying this equation, we get:

99a - 99c = 495

Dividing both sides by 99, we get:

a - c = 5

Now we have three equations:

h + t + u = 17
h^2 + t^2 + u^2 = 109
a - c = 5

We can use the first equation to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other two. Let's solve for u:

u

Q: If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?
I. Q is the square of a prime number.
II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
III. Q is the product of two prime numbers. Answer Choices: (A) I only (B) III only (C) II only (D) I and II only (E) I and III only
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Q has 5 factors. We can list out the possible combinations of factors for a number with 5 factors: 1, Q, p, q, and pq (where p and q are distinct prime numbers). 

Now, let's consider each statement: 

I. Q is the square of a prime number. 
If Q is the square of a prime number, then its factors are 1, p, and p^2. This only gives us 3 factors, so this statement cannot be true. 

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number. 
If Q is the fourth power of a prime number, then its factors are 1, p, p^2, p^3, and p^4. This gives us 5 factors, so this statement could be true. 

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers. 
If Q is the product of two prime numbers, then its factors are 1, p, q, and pq. This gives us 4 factors, so this statement cannot be true. 

Therefore, the only statement that could be true is II, so the answer is (C) II only.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent the given information. Let J be Joe's age, S be his sister's age, and F be his father's age. We know that:

J + S + F = 100 (the sum of their ages is 100)

When Joe is as old as his father, we can set their ages equal to each other:

J + X = F + X (where X is the number of years until Joe is as old as his father)

Solving for X, we get:

X = F - J

So when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice her current age:

S + X = 2S

Substituting X, we get:

S + F - J = 2S

Simplifying, we get:

F = S + J

Now we can use this equation and the original equation to solve for F. Substituting S + J for F in the first equation, we get:

J + S + S + J = 100

Simplifying, we get:

2J + 2S = 100 - S

3J + 3S = 100

Dividing by 3, we get:

J + S =

Q: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : Answer Choices: (A) 18 (B) 20 (C) 25 (D) 26 (E) 27
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that the ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months. This means that the difference in age between any two consecutive members is 3 months.

We also know that the youngest member is 7 years old. We can convert this to months by multiplying by 12: 7 years x 12 months/year = 84 months.

Let's call the number of members in the club "n". Then, the ages of the members can be represented by the A.P.:

84, 84 + 3, 84 + 6, 84 + 9, ..., 84 + 3(n-1)

The sum of an A.P. is given by the formula:

sum = (n/2)(first term + last term)

In this case, the first term is 84 and the last term is 84 + 3(n-1). So, we can write:

250 = (n/2)(84 + 84 + 3(n-1))

Simplifying this equation, we get:

250 = (n/2)(3n + 165)

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

Q: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? Answer Choices: (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes (B) 2 hour and 31 minutes (C) 3 hour and 31 minutes (D) 4 hour and 31 minutes (E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for each ball to complete one full rotation. 

For ball A, it takes 26/2 = 13 minutes to complete one full rotation. 

For ball B, it takes 35/5 = 7 minutes to complete one full rotation. 

Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 7, which is 91. This means that after 91 minutes, both balls will be back at the same starting point. 

However, we need to check if they are both at the starting point at the same time. 

After 91 minutes, ball A will have completed 7 rotations (91/13 = 7 with a remainder of 0) and ball B will have completed 13 rotations (91/7 = 13 with a remainder of 0). 

Therefore, both balls will be at the same starting point after 91 minutes. 

The answer is (A) 1 hour and 31 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two integers is 11. This means that both integers can be written as 11 multiplied by some other numbers. Let's call these numbers x and y. So, we have:

First integer = 11x
Second integer = 11y

Next, we know that the least common multiple (LCM) of these two integers is 7700. We can use the formula:

LCM = (first integer x second integer) / GCF

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

7700 = (11x) x (11y) / 11

Simplifying, we get:

7700 = 121xy

Dividing both sides by 121, we get:

64 = xy

Now we know that one of the integers is 350, so we can plug that in for one of the variables:

350y = 64

Solving for y, we get:

y = 64/350

y = 0.1829

But y has to be a positive integer, so we need to find the closest integer to 0.1829 that will give us a product of 64. We can try different values of

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

To reach the top of the stairs, the boy can take either one or two steps at a time. Let's start by considering the number of ways he can reach the top if he takes only one step at a time.

If the boy takes one step at a time, he has to take 10 steps to reach the top. He can take the first step in one way, the second step in one way, the third step in one way, and so on. Therefore, the total number of ways he can reach the top by taking one step at a time is 1 x 1 x 1 x ... (10 times) = 1.

Now, let's consider the number of ways he can reach the top if he takes two steps at a time.

If the boy takes two steps at a time, he can take the first two steps in one way, the next two steps in one way, and so on. However, he cannot take the last step in two steps because there is only one step left. Therefore, he has to take the last step in one step. So, the total number of ways he can reach the top by taking two steps at a time is 1 x 1 x

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assign variables to the lengths of the two pieces of rope. Let x be the length of the longer piece, and x-3 be the length of the shorter piece. 

We know that the sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 20 meters, so we can write an equation: 

x + (x-3) = 20 

Simplifying this equation: 

2x - 3 = 20 

Adding 3 to both sides: 

2x = 23 

Dividing both sides by 2: 

x = 11.5 

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters, which is answer choice (D).

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that the salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale. So, for each sale of $250, the salesperson earns a commission of:

10% of $250 = 0.1 x $250 = $25

Now, we need to figure out how many sales the salesperson needs to make in order to earn a salary of at least $1000. Let's call the number of sales the salesperson needs to make "x".

The total commission earned by the salesperson for "x" sales of $250 each would be:

Total commission = $25 x "x"

We want this total commission to be at least $1000, so we can set up an equation:

$25 x "x" ≥ $1000

Now we can solve for "x":

x ≥ $1000 ÷ $25

x ≥ 40

So the salesperson needs to make at least 40 sales of $250 each in order to earn a salary of at least $1000.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 40. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 40.

Q: A man walks at 5 kmph for 6 hrs and at 4 kmph for 12 hrs. His average speed is Answer Choices: (A) 4 1/3 km/h (B) 7 2/3 km/h (C) 9 ½ km/h (D) 8 km/h (E) 81 km/h
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's start by finding the total distance covered by the man. 

Distance covered at 5 kmph for 6 hours = 5 x 6 = 30 km 

Distance covered at 4 kmph for 12 hours = 4 x 12 = 48 km 

Total distance covered = 30 + 48 = 78 km 

Now, let's find the total time taken by the man. 

Total time taken = 6 + 12 = 18 hours 

Finally, let's find the average speed of the man. 

Average speed = Total distance covered / Total time taken 

Average speed = 78 / 18 = 4 1/3 km/h 

Therefore, the answer is (A) 4 1/3 km/h. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 4 1/3 km/h.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's start by using the discriminant formula to find the conditions for the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots. The discriminant is given by b^2 - 4ac, where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. In this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = k. So, the discriminant is:

b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive. So, we have:

25 - 4k > 0

Solving for k, we get:

k < 25/4

The largest integral value of k that satisfies this inequality is k = 6. Therefore, the answer is not among the given answer choices.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

First, we need to find the combined speed of the two ants. To do this, we add their individual speeds: 9 cm/hour + 6 cm/hour = 15 cm/hour.

Next, we can use the formula distance = speed x time to find how long it will take for the ants to meet. Let's call this time "t". We know that the distance between the farms is 75 cm, and the combined speed of the ants is 15 cm/hour. So:

75 = 15t

Solving for t, we get:

t = 5 hours

Now we can use the formula distance = speed x time again to find how far ant A travels until meeting ant B. We know that ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm/hour, and it takes 5 hours for the ants to meet. So:

distance = speed x time
distance = 9 cm/hour x 5 hours
distance = 45 cm

Therefore, the answer is (A) 45.

After the first group has been served, there will be 5 bottles left for the second group. We need to choose 5 bottles out of these 5 for the second group. This can be done in only 1 way.

Therefore, the total number of ways to create the 2 groups is 252 x 1 = 252.

Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the number of pens the company needs to manufacture to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler. Since 10% of the produced pens are defective, the company needs to manufacture more than 7200 pens to account for the defective ones. 

Let's use x to represent the number of pens the company needs to manufacture. Then, we can set up the following equation:

x - 0.1x = 7200

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0.9x = 7200

x = 8000

So, the company needs to manufacture 8000 pens to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler.

Next, we need to calculate the overall profit on all the manufactured pens. The company estimates this profit to be 25%. Let's use C to represent the manufactured cost of each pen. Then, we can set up the following equation:

8000C * 1.25 = 8000 * 10

Simplifying this equation, we get:

C = 7.2

Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 7.2. 

The answer is (B) Rs. 7.2.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for all three bells to ring together. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 36, 40, and 48.

The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 x 3^2.
The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 x 5.
The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 x 3.

To find the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers. So the LCM is 2^4 x 3^2 x 5 = 720 seconds.

Therefore, the bells will ring together again after 720 seconds, which is 12 minutes. So the answer is (B) After 12 minutes. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) After 12 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's start by drawing the cross-section of the canal. 

We know that the canal is shaped like a trapezium, which means it has two parallel sides and two non-parallel sides. Let's label the top width as 10 m and the bottom width as 6 m. 

We also know that the area of the cross-section is 640 square meters. We can use the formula for the area of a trapezium to find the height or depth of the canal. 

Area of trapezium = (sum of parallel sides) x (height) / 2 

Substituting the given values, we get: 

640 = (10 + 6) x (height) / 2 

Simplifying, we get: 

640 = 8 x height 

Height = 80 

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 meters.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that the average weight of 10 oarsmen increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man. 

Let's call the weight of the new man "x". 

We can use the formula for average weight: 

Average weight = (sum of weights)/(number of people)

Before the replacement, the sum of weights was: 

10 oarsmen * average weight = 10 * (average weight)

After the replacement, the sum of weights became: 

9 oarsmen * average weight + x (weight of the new man)

We know that the new average weight is 1.8 kg more than the old average weight, so we can set up an equation: 

10 * (average weight) + 53 = 9 * (average weight + 1.8) + x

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

10 * (average weight) + 53 = 9 * (average weight) + 16.2 + x

Subtracting 9 * (average weight) from both sides, we get: 

average weight + 53 = 16.2 + x 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 71. 

To solve for x, we can subtract 53 from both sides: 

average weight = x - 36.8 

Now

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's find out how many cakes one helper can make in 3 hours. Since one helper can make 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour, in 3 hours, they can make:

2 large cakes/hour x 3 hours = 6 large cakes
35 small cakes/hour x 3 hours = 105 small cakes

Next, let's find out how many cakes all the helpers can make in 3 hours. Let's say there are x helpers. Then, in 3 hours, they can make:

6 large cakes/helper x x helpers = 6x large cakes
105 small cakes/helper x x helpers = 105x small cakes

We know that we need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in total. So we can set up two equations:

6x = 20 (since we need 20 large cakes)
105x = 700 (since we need 700 small cakes)

Solving for x in each equation, we get:

x = 20/6 = 3.33 (rounded to two decimal places)
x = 700/105 = 6.67 (rounded to two decimal places)

Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the two numbers in the ratio 3:5 be 3x and 5x, respectively.

When 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are (3x - 9) and (5x - 9), respectively.

We are given that the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23, so we can set up the equation:

(3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23

Cross-multiplying, we get:

23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)

Simplifying, we get:

69x - 207 = 60x - 108

9x = 99

x = 11

Therefore, the smaller number (3x) is:

3x = 3(11) = 33

A: Let's think step by step. Roy has 5 tablets and he needs to take one tablet every 15 minutes. 

So, the total time it will take for Roy to consume all the 5 tablets can be calculated by multiplying the time interval between each tablet by the total number of tablets. 

Time interval between each tablet = 15 minutes 

Total number of tablets = 5 

Total time = 15 minutes x 5 tablets = 75 minutes

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula distance = speed x time to find the distance Kevin traveled on his first leg of the trip from A to B. Let's call this distance "x". 

distance = speed x time 
x = 70 mph x t 

Next, we can use the same formula to find the distance Kevin traveled on his second leg of the trip from B back to A. Let's call this distance "y". 

distance = speed x time 
y = 90 mph x (t - 3) 

Notice that we subtract 3 from the total time because we know that 3 hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was still 70 miles away from B. 

Now, we can use the fact that the total distance traveled is equal to the sum of the distances traveled on each leg of the trip. 

total distance = x + y 

We also know that the distance from A to B is equal to the distance from B to A, so we can set x = y. 

x + y = 2x 

Substituting in our expressions for x and y, we get: 

70t + 90(t - 3) = 2(70t) 

Simplifying, we get:

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we know that the number is 5 digits long. Let's represent the number as abcde, where a, b, c, d, and e are digits.

Next, we know that if we add a 1 after the number, it becomes three times as large as if we add a 1 before the number. This can be represented as:

abcde1 = 3(1abcde)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

abcde1 = 30000 + 3abcde

Now we can solve for abcde:

abcde1 - 30000 = 3abcde
abcde = (abcde1 - 30000) / 3

We know that abcde is a 5-digit number, so it must be between 10000 and 99999. Let's try each answer choice and see which one satisfies the equation:

(A) 42857: (428571 - 30000) / 3 = 42857, so this answer choice works.

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's represent the two-digit number as 10x + y, where x is the digit in the ten's place and y is the digit in the unit's place.

We know that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, so we can write an equation:

10x + y = x + y + 18

Simplifying this equation, we get:

9x = 18

x = 2

Now we know that the digit in the ten's place is 2. We also know that the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, so y = 2x = 4.

Therefore, the number is 10x + y = 10(2) + 4 = 24.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that the two cars are starting from opposite ends of a 50-mile highway. This means that they are 50 miles apart from each other when they start.

We also know that one car is traveling at 12 mph and the other is traveling at 13 mph. This means that they are moving towards each other at a combined speed of 12 + 13 = 25 mph.

To find out how long it will take for them to meet, we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

In this case, the distance they need to cover is 50 miles (since they are meeting in the middle of the highway), and their combined speed is 25 mph. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

time = 50 / 25
time = 2

So it will take them 2 hours to meet in the middle of the highway. Therefore, the answer is (E) 2.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of cubes that make up the larger cube. Since the larger cube has a size of 5cm and a thickness of 1cm, the number of smaller cubes in each dimension is 5-2=3. Therefore, the total number of smaller cubes is 3^3 = 27.

Next, we need to find the number of smaller cubes that have at least one face painted. Since the outer surface of the larger cube is painted, we need to find the number of cubes that are on the surface. There are 6 faces on the larger cube, and each face has a dimension of 5cm x 5cm. Since the thickness of the larger cube is 1cm, the inner cube has a dimension of 3cm x 3cm. Therefore, the number of cubes on each face is (5/3)^2 = 2.78, which we can round down to 2. This means that there are 2 cubes on each edge of the larger cube, and there are 4 edges on each face, so there are 8 cubes on each face that have at least one face painted. Therefore, the total number of smaller cubes that have at least one face painted is 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 450.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that the plane flies along the four sides of a square, so the distance it covers is the perimeter of the square. Let's call the length of one side of the square "s". Then, the perimeter of the square is 4s.

We also know the speeds at which the plane flies along each side of the square. Let's call these speeds v1, v2, v3, and v4.

To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken. We can find the total distance traveled by adding up the distances traveled along each side of the square. We can find the time taken by dividing the distance traveled by the speed.

So, the total distance traveled is:

s + s + s + s = 4s

The time taken to travel each side of the square is:

s/v1, s/v2, s/v3, and s/v4

Therefore, the total time taken is:

s/v1 + s/v2 + s/v3 + s/v4

Q: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation? Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45%
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 75% of the employees take a winter vacation. This means that 25% of the employees do not take a winter vacation.

Next, we know that 40% of the employees take both a winter and a summer vacation. This means that 60% of the employees do not take both vacations.

Finally, we know that 20% of the employees take neither vacation. This means that 80% of the employees take at least one vacation.

To find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we need to subtract the percentage of employees who take both vacations from the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation.

So, the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation is:

(100% - 75%) - (40%) + (20%) = 5%

Therefore, the answer is (A) 5%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 5%.

Q: A shopkeeper in order to promote his new shop put a discount of 20% on all the items for one day. Now he must sell the items at original price the other day. By what percentage must he increase the price to original? Answer Choices: (A) 21% (B) 20% (C) 25% (D) 33% (E) 18%
A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that an item originally costs $100. With a 20% discount, the shopkeeper sells it for $80. 

Now, the shopkeeper wants to sell the item at its original price of $100. To find out what percentage increase is needed, we can use the formula:

% increase = (new value - original value) / original value x 100%

In this case, the new value is $100 and the original value is $80. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

% increase = (100 - 80) / 80 x 100%
% increase = 25%

Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to sell the item at its original price. 

The answer is (C) 25%. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (C) 25%.

Q: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many boys and girls joined the group during the membership drive. Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we can assume that the same number of boys and girls joined the group. Let's call this number "x".

So, we now have 64 + x boys and 40 + x girls in the group.

To find the total number of members in the group, we simply add the number of boys and girls:

Total members = (64 + x) + (40 + x)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Total members = 104 + 2x

Now, we need to solve for "x". We know that the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, so we can set up the following equation:

(64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3

Cross-multiplying, we get:

3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)

Expanding the brackets, we get:

192 + 3x = 160 + 4x

Solving for "x", we get:

x = 32

Now, we can substitute this value of "x" into our expression for the total number of members 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 277. 

Total members = 104 + 2x = 104 + 2(32) = 168 + 104 =

Q: 10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? Answer Choices: (A) 10/7 (B) 20/7 (C) 30/7 (D) 40/7 (E) 50/7
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much sand and clay are currently in the mixture. 

10 kg of the mixture contains 30% sand, so the amount of sand in the mixture is:

0.3 x 10 kg = 3 kg

Similarly, the amount of clay in the mixture is:

0.7 x 10 kg = 7 kg

Now, we want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of sand and clay. Let's call the amount of sand and clay we need to add "x" kg. 

After we add x kg of sand, the total amount of sand in the mixture will be:

3 kg + x kg

And the total amount of clay in the mixture will be:

7 kg + (10 - x) kg (since we are removing x kg of the mixture)

Since we want the mixture to contain equal quantities of sand and clay, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:

3 kg + x kg = 7 kg + (10 - x) kg

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x = 4

x = 2

So we need to remove 2 kg of the mixture and replace it with 2 kg of pure sand. 

Therefore, the answer 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is not listed. The correct answer is 2 kg or 2/7 of the original mixture.

Q: Anna has 4 books. If she decide to arrange the 4 books in every possible combination and moved just one book every minute, how long would it taken by her ? Answer Choices: (A) 22 minutes (B) 30 minutes (C) 15 minutes (D) 24 minutes (E) 35 minutes
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many possible combinations there are for 4 books. This can be calculated using the formula for permutations, which is n!/(n-r)!, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items being arranged. In this case, n=4 and r=4, so the formula becomes 4!/0!, which simplifies to 4x3x2x1=24.

Next, we need to figure out how long it would take Anna to move one book in each combination. Since there are 4 books and she is moving one book per minute, it will take her 4 minutes to go through all the combinations once.

Finally, we need to multiply the number of combinations by the time it takes to move one book in each combination. This gives us 24x4=96 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Susan must be on the left of Tim, so we can fix Susan in the leftmost chair. Then, we have two options for the middle chair: either Tim sits there or Zen sits there. Once we have chosen who sits in the middle chair, the last person will sit in the rightmost chair. Therefore, there are only 2 possible arrangements: Susan-Tim-Zen or Susan-Zen-Tim.

Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 200 (C) 400 (D) 100 (E) 500
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume that there are 'n' employees in the organization.

According to the problem, if each employee contributes equally, then the total contribution would be Rs. 6 lakh.

So, the contribution of each employee would be 6 lakh/n.

Now, if each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, then the new contribution of each employee would be (6 lakh + 60n)/n.

According to the problem, the new contribution would be Rs. 6.24 lakh.

So, we can write the equation as:

(6 lakh + 60n)/n = 6.24 lakh

Simplifying this equation, we get:

6000 + 60n = 6240n

6240n - 60n = 6000

n(6240 - 60) = 6000

n = 6000/6180

n = 100

Therefore, there are 100 employees in the organization.

Q: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 16 (C) 17 (D) 18 (E) 19
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use the formula: 

1/A + 1/B = 1/X 

where A is the time it takes for Alex to make a toy, B is the time it takes for Jacob to make a toy, and X is the time it takes for both of them to make a toy together. 

Plugging in the values we have: 

1/7 + 1/9 = 1/X 

Multiplying both sides by 63X: 

9X + 7X = 63 

16X = 63 

X = 63/16 

So together, Alex and Jacob can make 1 toy in 63/16 hours. 

Next, we can use the fact that they made 35 toys in total to set up an equation: 

Let's say Alex made A toys and Jacob made J toys. 

A + J = 35 

We also know that they worked for almost similar number of hours, so we can assume that they each worked for half the total time. 

Let T be the total time they worked. 

T/2 * (1/7 + 1/9) = 35 

Multiplying both sides by 126: 

9T + 7T = 441 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 18. 

To find how many toys Jacob made, we can use the equation A + J = 35 and substitute A with 35 -

Q: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower.

After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? Answer Choices: (A) 5 (√3 + 1)  (B) 6 (√3 + √2)  (C) 7 (√3 – 1)  (D) 8 (√3 – 2)  (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to draw a diagram to visualize the problem. 

We have a car moving towards a tower, and the angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. 

Let's label the height of the tower as h, and the distance between the car and the base of the tower as x. 

Using trigonometry, we can write:

tan 45° = h/x 

tan 60° = h/(x + d) 

where d is the distance the car travels in the additional time it takes to reach the base of the tower. 

We can simplify these equations to:

x = h 

x + d = h/√3 

Now we can solve for d:

d = h/√3 - h 

d = h(√3 - 1) 

We know that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°, so we can use this information to find the speed of the car:

10 minutes = 1/6 hour 

tan 60° - tan 45° = (h/√3)/(x + d) - h/x

What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. This means that the total weight of all 10 vehicles combined is:

10 vehicles x 12.2 tons/vehicle = 122 tons

Now, we add a new heavy duty truck to the group, and the average weight of the group increases by 2.6 tons. Let's call the weight of the heavy duty truck "x" tons. 

The new total weight of all 11 vehicles combined is:

11 vehicles x (12.2 + 2.6) tons/vehicle = 154.8 tons

We can set up an equation to solve for x:

(122 + x) / 11 = 15.48

Simplifying this equation, we get:

122 + x = 170.28

x = 48.28

Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 48.28 tons, which is closest to answer choice (A) 40.8.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many voters are eligible to vote. We know that 20% are not eligible, so we can subtract that from the total number of voters:

5000 - (20% of 5000) = 5000 - 1000 = 4000

So there are 4000 eligible voters.

Next, we need to find out how many votes the winning candidate got. We know that they won by 15% of the votes, so we can calculate that percentage of the total number of votes:

15% of 4000 = 0.15 x 4000 = 600

So the winning candidate got 600 votes.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 2300, which is the number of votes the winning candidate did not get:

4000 - 600 = 2300

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

We know that an orange costs 18 dollars, a pineapple costs 27 dollars, and a grape costs 15 dollars. 

To find out how much a mango costs, we need to look for a pattern or relationship between the prices of the fruits. 

One way to do this is to look for common factors or multiples. For example, we can see that 3 is a common factor of 18 and 27, and 5 is a common factor of 15 and 27. 

Another way is to look at the differences between the prices. For example, we can see that the difference between the price of an orange and a grape is 3 dollars, and the difference between the price of a pineapple and an orange is 9 dollars. 

Using these methods, we can try to guess the price of a mango. 

One possible answer is (C) 20 dollars. This is because 20 is a multiple of both 10 (the price of a grape) and 18 (the price of an orange), and it is also close to the difference between the price of a pineapple and an orange (9 dollars).

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assume that Mr. Sam takes x hours to go to the city by train and y hours to return by car. 

According to the problem, we know that: 

x + y = 17 (since it takes him 17 hours to go by train and return by car) 

Also, we know that if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. This means that: 

2x = 17 - 4 = 13 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 6.5 

Substituting this value of x in the first equation, we get: 

6.5 + y = 17 

Solving for y, we get: 

y = 10.5 

So, if Mr. Sam had traveled by car in both ways, he would have taken y + y = 10.5 + 10.5 = 21 hours.

Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and Y separately. 

For alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. This means that for every 2 parts of zinc, there are 3 parts of copper. 

So, if we have 40 grams of alloy X, we can split it into 2x and 3x parts of zinc and copper, respectively. 

2x + 3x = 40 

5x = 40 

x = 8 

Therefore, alloy X contains 16 grams of zinc and 24 grams of copper. 

Similarly, for alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which simplifies to 1:1.57 (rounded to two decimal places). This means that for every 1 part of zinc, there are 1.57 parts of copper. 

So, if we have 60 grams of alloy Y, we can split it into 1x and 1.57x parts of zinc and copper, respectively. 

1x + 1.57x = 60 

2.57x = 60

Meenu's weight = 29 + 0.5Meenu's weight
Meenu's weight - 0.5Meenu's weight = 29
0.5Meenu's weight = 29

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the shuttle's speed. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken: 

Speed = Distance / Time 

Speed = 700m / 40s 

Speed = 17.5 m/s 

Next, we need to find the distance the shuttle travels during the 5 seconds it takes to pass a point. We can do this by multiplying the speed by the time: 

Distance = Speed x Time 

Distance = 17.5 m/s x 5s 

Distance = 87.5 m 

Finally, we can find the length of the shuttle by subtracting the distance traveled during the 5 seconds from the total distance traveled in 40 seconds: 

Length of shuttle = Total distance - Distance traveled in 5 seconds 

Length of shuttle = 700m - 87.5m 

Length of shuttle = 612.5m

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the common multiple of 9 and 12. The prime factorization of 9 is 3 x 3, and the prime factorization of 12 is 2 x 2 x 3. To find the common multiple, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either 9 or 12. So, the common multiple is 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 = 36.

Next, we need to check which of the answer choices is a multiple of 36. We can do this by dividing each answer choice by 36 and seeing if the result is a whole number. 

(A) 36 is a multiple of 36, so it is divisible by both 9 and 12.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's start by drawing a rectangle and labeling its sides. Let's call the length of the rectangle "l" and the width "w". 

Next, let's consider what happens when we fold the rectangle in half along one set of sides. This means that the length of each folded part will be "l/2" and the width will still be "w". The perimeter of each folded part will be the sum of the lengths of all four sides, so for each folded part, the perimeter will be:

2(l/2 + w) = l + 2w

We know that this perimeter is 48cm, so we can set up an equation:

l + 2w = 48

Similarly, when we fold the rectangle in half along the other set of sides, the length of each folded part will be "w/2" and the width will still be "l". The perimeter of each folded part will be:

2(w/2 + l) = w + 2l

We know that this perimeter is 66cm, so we can set up another equation:

w + 2l = 66

Now we have two equations with two variables (l and w), so we can solve for them. One

Train B leaves every 17 minutes, so it will leave again after 17 minutes, 34 minutes, 51 minutes, and so on.

To find the next time both trains leave simultaneously, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17.

The prime factorization of 16 is 2^4 and the prime factorization of 17 is just 17.

To find the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. So the LCM of 16 and 17 is 2^4 * 17 = 272.

Therefore, both trains will leave the station simultaneously again after 272 minutes.

The answer is (A) 272 minutes. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 272 minutes.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that initially, M men agreed to purchase a gift for Rs. D. Therefore, each man would have to contribute D/M rupees towards the gift.

Now, if 3 men drop out, the total number of men left would be M-3. The total amount of money required to purchase the gift would still be D rupees.

Therefore, each man would now have to contribute D/(M-3) rupees towards the gift.

So, the answer is (A) D/(M-3).

Q: What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729. Answer Choices: (A) 37 (B) 38 (C) 36 (D) 30 (E) 39
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. 

We are given that the product of three consecutive integers can be expressed as 727+728+729. 

We can simplify this expression by adding the three numbers together: 

727 + 728 + 729 = 2184 

So, the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184. 

Let's use algebra to solve for the three consecutive integers. 

Let x be the smallest of the three consecutive integers. 

Then, the next two consecutive integers are x+1 and x+2. 

We know that the product of these three integers is 2184: 

x(x+1)(x+2) = 2184 

Expanding the left side: 

x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x = 2184 

Rearranging: 

x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 2184 = 0 

We can use trial and error to find that x = 12 is a solution to this equation. 

Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14. 

And their sum is: 

12 + 13 + 14 = 39 

So, the answer is 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (E) 39.

Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students. Answer Choices: (A) 8880 (B) 8870 (C) 8890 (D) 7890 (E) 6780
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8, which is 80. This means that we can assume there are 80 students in the class.

Next, we can find the number of students studying each subject by multiplying the fraction by the total number of students. 

- Math: 1/16 x 80 = 5
- Bio: 1/10 x 80 = 8
- English: 1/8 x 80 = 10

The total number of students is 5 + 8 + 10 = 23. However, we assumed there were 80 students in the class, so we need to find the equivalent fraction for 23 out of 80. 

23/80 = 0.2875

To find the maximum number of students, we can round up 0.2875 to 0.29 and multiply by 10000 (since the total number of students is a 4 digit number). 

0.29 x 10000 = 2900

To find the minimum number of students, we can round down 0.2875 to 0.28 and multiply by 10000.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we need to find out how many toys are in one tempo. To do this, we can multiply the number of boxes in one tempo by the number of toys in each box:

Number of toys in one box = 5 dozen = 5 x 12 = 60
Number of toys in one tempo = 98 x 60 = 5880

Next, we need to find out how many tempos are needed to lift 29400 toys. To do this, we can divide the total number of toys by the number of toys in one tempo:

Number of tempos needed = 29400 ÷ 5880 = 5

Therefore, the answer is (B) 5.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to convert the rate of rotation from revolutions per minute to revolutions per second. 

300 revolutions per minute = 5 revolutions per second (since there are 60 seconds in a minute) 

Next, we need to find the circumference of the circle that the point on the fan blade travels. 

The radius of the circle is 10 centimeters, so the circumference is 2πr = 20π centimeters. 

Finally, we can find the distance traveled by multiplying the circumference by the number of revolutions and the time. 

Distance traveled = 20π x 5 x 30 = 3000π centimeters 

Therefore, the answer is (D) 3000π. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 3000pi.

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001. Let's assume that all of these deer are still alive and in the forest in 2002. 

Next, we know that out of the 500 deer caught in 2002, only 20 had tags from the previous year. This means that the proportion of tagged deer in the 500 sample is 20/500 = 0.04. 

If we assume that this proportion is representative of the entire deer population in the forest, then we can set up the following equation: 

0.04x = 300 

where x is the total deer population in the forest. 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 300/0.04 = 7500 

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500, which is answer choice (E).

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that 5 years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. Let's represent Rahim's age 5 years ago as x. 

So, Raj's age 5 years ago would be (1/3)x. 

Now, we also know that Raj is currently 17 years old. So, Raj's age 5 years ago would have been 12. 

Using this information, we can set up an equation: 

(1/3)x = 12 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 36 

Therefore, Rahim's age now would be 36 + 5 = 41. 

So, the answer is (B) 41.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

First, we need to find the number of integers in set S that are relatively prime to 1,000. To do this, we can use Euler's totient function, which gives us the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. 

In this case, we want to find the number of integers less than or equal to 1,000 that are relatively prime to 1,000. So, we can use the formula:

φ(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 400

This tells us that there are 400 integers in set S that are relatively prime to 1,000.

Next, we need to find the total number of integers in set S. Since set S contains all integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive, the total number of integers in set S is simply 1,000.

Finally, we can calculate the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 by dividing the number of integers in set S that are relatively prime to 1,000 by the total number of integers in set S:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the 5 consecutive odd numbers. We can start with the smallest odd number greater than or equal to 41 (the smallest odd two-digit number). 

Let's call this number "x". Then the next four consecutive odd numbers would be x+2, x+4, x+6, and x+8. 

The sum of these five numbers is 5x+20. 

Now we need to divide this sum by 10 and get a perfect square. 

So, we have: 

5x+20 = 10k^2 

where k is a positive integer. 

Dividing both sides by 5, we get: 

x+4 = 2k^2 

Rearranging, we get: 

x = 2k^2 - 4 

Now we can check which of the answer choices can be expressed in this form. 

(A) 47 cannot be expressed in this form. 

(B) 91 = 2(6^2) - 4, so it is possible.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Mark said, "If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75."

Let's assume John had x amount of money. So, if he gives half of his money to Mark, Mark will have (x/2) + 75.

John said, "If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-."

If Mark gives one-third of his money to John, John will have (x/3) + 75.

Now, we can set up an equation:

(x/2) + 75 = (x/3) + 75

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x/6 = 0

This means that x = 0. Therefore, John had no money.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's start by drawing a diagram to visualize the problem. 

We know that U is the midpoint of ST, so we can divide ST into two equal parts of length 11 each. 

Now, we can see that RU is the sum of RS and SU. We know that RS has a length of 5, and since U is the midpoint of ST, SU also has a length of 11. 

Therefore, RU = RS + SU = 5 + 11 = 16.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length and breadth of the rectangular piece. 

Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is x meters. 

According to the problem, the length is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth. 

So, the length = 4x + 1 meters 

Now, we know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m. 

Area = length x breadth 

150 = (4x + 1) x x 

150 = 4x^2 + x 

4x^2 + x - 150 = 0 

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: 

x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a 

where a = 4, b = 1, and c = -150 

x = (-1 ± sqrt(1^2 - 4(4)(-150))) / 2(4) 

x = (-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2400)) / 8 

x = (-1 ± sqrt(2401)) / 8 

x = (-1 ± 49) / 8 

x = 6 or x = -25/4 

Since the breadth cannot be

Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that the worker worked for 15 consecutive days and the average wage for the entire fortnight was $90 per day. 

We also know that the average wage for the first 7 days was $87 per day and the average wage for the last 7 days was $92 per day. 

To find the wage on the 8th day, we can use the formula:

Total wages for the fortnight = Average wage per day x Number of days worked

We can break down the total wages for the fortnight into three parts:

Total wages for the first 7 days = $87 x 7 = $609
Total wages for the last 7 days = $92 x 7 = $644
Total wages for the entire fortnight = $90 x 15 = $1350

Now, we can find the total wages for the 8th day by subtracting the total wages for the first 7 days and the last 7 days from the total wages for the entire fortnight:

Total wages for the 8th day = $1350 - $609 - $644 = $97

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use algebra to represent the problem. Let Ajay's present age be A and Rahul's present age be R. We know that:

(A - 6) / 18 = R

We also know that:

R = D - 2, where D is Denis's age and D = 5.

Substituting R in the first equation, we get:

(A - 6) / 18 = D - 2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

A - 6 = 18(D - 2)

A - 6 = 18(5 - 2)

A - 6 = 54

A = 60

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Let's assume the number is "x".

According to the problem, "10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number". So, we can write this as:

(2/3)x - 10

The problem also states that "the result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number". So, we can write this as:

(1/3)x + 40

Now, we can set these two expressions equal to each other and solve for x:

(2/3)x - 10 = (1/3)x + 40

Multiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fractions, we get:

2x - 30 = x + 120

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

x = 150

How many different codes can be made? Answer Choices: (A) 1,980 (B) 2,020 (C) 2,100 (D) 2,200 (E) 1,900
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to choose the middle vowel. There are 5 vowels to choose from.

Next, we need to choose the first and third consonants. There are 20 consonants to choose from for the first letter, and 19 consonants left to choose from for the third letter (since it cannot be the same as the first letter). So, there are 20 x 19 = 380 ways to choose the first and third consonants.

Finally, we need to arrange the letters in the code. We have 3 positions to fill, and we already know the middle letter is a vowel. So, we have 4 letters left to choose from for the first position (since we cannot use the middle vowel or the chosen first consonant), and 18 letters left to choose from for the third position (since we cannot use the middle vowel or the chosen third consonant). Therefore, there are 4 x 1 x 18 = 72 ways to arrange the letters.

Multiplying all of these together, we get:

5 x 380 x 72 = 136,800

Therefore, there are 136,800 different codes that can be made. The answer choice closest to this is (E) 1,900, but

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many trousers the man can buy with the given amount of money. 

We know that each trouser costs Rs 70, so the number of trousers the man can buy is:

810 / 70 = 11.57

Since the man cannot buy a fraction of a trouser, we can round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the man can buy 11 trousers.

Next, we need to find out how many shirts the man can buy with the remaining amount of money. 

We know that each shirt costs Rs 30, so the remaining amount of money after buying 11 trousers is:

810 - (11 x 70) = 40

The number of shirts the man can buy with Rs 40 is:

40 / 30 = 1.33

Again, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the man can buy 1 shirt.

So, the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased is:

11 : 1

Q: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

The terms 4/30, n/100 mean that the merchant can get a 4% discount if they pay within 30 days, or they can pay the full amount within n days and not get any discount.

So, if the merchant pays within 30 days, they will only have to pay 96% of the original amount, which is:

0.96 x $20,000 = $19,200

Now, let's say the merchant wants to borrow money to take advantage of the discount. They will have to pay back the borrowed amount plus interest within 30 days. Let's call the borrowed amount "P" and the interest rate "r".

So, the amount the merchant will have to pay back after 30 days is:

P + P x r

This amount should be less than or equal to $19,200, otherwise, the merchant will not be able to take advantage of the discount.

Therefore, we can write the following inequality:

P + P x r ≤ $19,200

Simplifying this inequality, we get:

P(1 + r) ≤ $19,200

Now, let's say the merchant wants to borrow the maximum amount they can afford to 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 215.67. 

To find this answer, we need to solve for "r" in the inequality we just derived:

Q: Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos? Answer Choices: (A) 24 minutes (B) 32 minutes (C) 36 minutes (D) 64 minutes (E) 72 minutes
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so in 1 minute it produces 1/6 of a yo-yo.

Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so in 1 minute it produces 1/9 of a yo-yo.

To find out how long it takes for them to produce 10 yo-yos, we can set up an equation:

(1/6 + 1/9) * t = 10

Simplifying this equation, we get:

5t/18 = 10

Multiplying both sides by 18/5, we get:

t = 36

Therefore, it will take 36 minutes for Machine A and Machine B to produce 10 yo-yos. So the answer is (C) 36 minutes.

The units digit of $9^1$ is 9, the units digit of $9^2$ is 1, and the units digit of $9^3$ is 9. 

So, $9^3$ has a units digit of 9.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's start by drawing a diagram to visualize the problem. 

We can represent the distance between A and C as x and the distance between C and B as y. 

Since Ram and Krishna are traveling towards each other, their combined speed is 20m/s + 40m/s = 60m/s. 

We know that Ram meets Krishna at point C after 10 seconds, so we can use the formula distance = speed x time to find the distance between A and C: 

distance AC = speed Ram x time = 20m/s x 10s = 200m 

Similarly, we can find the distance between C and B: 

distance CB = speed Krishna x time = 40m/s x 10s = 400m 

Now we can find the total distance between A and B by adding the distances AC and CB: 

total distance AB = distance AC + distance CB = 200m + 400m = 600m 

Therefore, the answer is (E) 600 meters.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we know that the median income is $3000. This means that half of the family members earn less than $3000 and half earn more than $3000.

Next, we know that the total income of the family is $9000. If we divide this by the median income of $3000, we get 3. This means that there are 3 family members who earn $3000 each.

However, we also know that there are family members who earn less than $3000 and family members who earn more than $3000. Since there are only 3 family members who earn $3000 each, there must be additional family members who earn less than $3000 to bring the median income down to $3000.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 4 family members.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the length of the two painted sides. We know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, and one side is unpainted and has a length of 9 feet. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two painted sides is 37 - 9 = 28 feet.

Next, we need to find the width of the parking space. We know that the width is the length of the unpainted side, which is 9 feet.

Now we can find the area of the parking space by multiplying the length and width. The length is the sum of the lengths of the two painted sides, which is 28 feet. Therefore, the area of the parking space is 28 x 9 = 252 square feet.

So the answer is (D) 252.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can see that the product of M and B is M, so B must be 1 (since any number multiplied by 0 is 0). 

Next, we can see that the product of A and E is A, so E must be 1 (again, any number multiplied by 0 is 0). 

Now we can fill in the first row of the table: 

M A D 
1 1 ? 

Moving on to the second row, we can see that the product of M and R is A. Since we know A is 1, we can deduce that M and R must be the same number. Looking at the first row, the only number that appears twice is 1, so M and R must both be 1. 

Next, we can see that the product of A and A is I. Since A is 1, we know that I must also be 1. 

Finally, we can see that the product of D and E is D. Since we know E is 1, we can deduce that D must be the same number as the product of D and 1, which is D. Therefore, D must be 0. 

So the completed table is:

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that there are 45 books in total, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. We want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.

To do this, we can use the formula:

Total = Group 1 + Group 2 - Both + Neither

In this case, Group 1 represents the number of hardcover books, Group 2 represents the number of fiction books, Both represents the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, and Neither represents the number of books that are neither hardcover nor fiction.

We know that Total = 45, Group 1 = 30, and Group 2 = 20. We want to find the maximum value of Both.

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

45 = 30 + 20 - Both + Neither

Simplifying, we get:

Neither = Both - 5

We know that Neither cannot be negative, so the minimum value of Both is 5. To find the maximum value of Both, we need to maximize Neither.

Since Neither represents the number of books that are neither hardcover nor fiction, it must be at least 0 and

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume Ajay's current age to be x. 

According to the problem, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. 

So, 10 years back, Sachin's age was (40-10) = 30 years old. 

And, 10 years back, Ajay's age was (x-10) years old. 

According to the problem, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. 

So, we can write the equation as: 

30 = 2(x-10) 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

x = 25 

Therefore, Ajay's current age is 25 years old. 

Hence, the answer is (B) 25.

Q: Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years.

Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 40% (C) 50% (D) 65% (E) 75%
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Let's assume the current population of Boomtown is "x". 

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. 

So, after one year, the population would be x + 0.1x = 1.1x. 

After two years, the population would be (1.1x) + (0.1x * 1.1x) = 1.21x. 

Now, we know that the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. 

So, 1.21x = 2(1.1x) 

Simplifying this equation, we get x = 2.1. 

Therefore, the current population of Boomtown is 2.1. 

Now, we need to find the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year. 

The population one year ago was 1.1x = 1.1(2.1) = 2.31. 

So, the percent population increase over the last year is (2.1 - 2.31)/2.31 * 100% = -9

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can set up two equations based on the information given:

504/M = 420/800  (since the candidate secured 504 out of M and 420 out of 800)
 
Simplifying this equation, we get:

504 x 800 = 420 x M

403200 = 420M

Dividing both sides by 420, we get:

M = 960

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the volume of the tank. 

Volume = length x width x height 

Volume = 8 m x 6 m x 2.5 m 

Volume = 120 cubic meters 

Now, we need to convert cubic meters to liters. 

1 cubic meter = 1000 liters 

Therefore, 

120 cubic meters = 120 x 1000 = 120000 liters 

So, the answer is (D) 120000 liters.

What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the time interval between the two trains. Since the main line train starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line train starts at 5.02 A.M., the time interval between them is 2 minutes.

Next, we need to determine the probability of the man catching the first train. Since both trains have a frequency of 10 minutes, we can assume that they arrive at random times within those 10-minute intervals. Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is equal to the ratio of the time interval between the two trains (2 minutes) to the frequency of the trains (10 minutes).

So, the probability of the man catching the first train is 2/10 or 0.2.

However, we need to remember that there are two trains, so the probability of the man catching either the main line or the harbor line train is 2 times the probability of catching just one train. Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 2 x 0.2 or 0.4.

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's represent the unknown number as "x". 

According to the problem, when 30 is subtracted from x, it is reduced to one third of its original value. We can write this as an equation: 

x - 30 = (1/3)x 

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation: 

(2/3)x = 30 

x = 45 

Now we know that the original number is 45. 

The problem asks us to find 50% of that number. We can calculate this by multiplying 45 by 0.5: 

45 x 0.5 = 22.5

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to determine the minimum number of ties we need to take out to ensure that we have at least two ties of the same color. 

The worst-case scenario is that we pick one tie of each color, which would give us a total of 5 ties. However, we still don't have two ties of the same color. 

If we pick one more tie, there are two possibilities: 

1. We pick a tie of a color that we already have, in which case we have at least two ties of that color. 
2. We pick a tie of a new color, in which case we still don't have two ties of the same color. 

Therefore, we need to pick at least 3 ties to ensure that we have at least two ties of the same color.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that the tennis team won 20 matches during the season. 

We also know that they lost 30% of their matches. 

To find out how many matches they lost, we need to calculate 30% of the total number of matches they played. 

We can do this by multiplying the total number of matches by 0.3 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%). 

So, if we let "x" be the total number of matches they played, we can set up the equation:

0.3x = number of matches lost 

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 0.3:

x = (number of matches lost) / 0.3 

Now we just need to plug in the information we have to solve for the number of matches lost:

x = (number of matches lost) / 0.3 

x = 20 + number of matches lost 

20 + number of matches lost = (number of matches lost) / 0.3 

Multiplying both sides by 0.3:

6 + 0.3(number of matches lost) = number of matches lost 

Subtracting 0.3(number of matches lost

Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that Charles received $54,080 at the end of one year, including both principal and interest. We also know that the investment paid an annual interest rate of 8 percent, compounded semi-annually. 

To solve for the original investment amount, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

where A is the final amount, P is the principal (or original investment), r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years.

In this case, we know A = $54,080, r = 0.08 (8%), n = 2 (since interest is compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 (since the investment is for one year). We want to solve for P.

So we can plug in these values and solve for P:

$54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)
$54,080 = P(1.04)^2
$54,080 = P(1.0816)
P = $54,080/1.0816

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to set up a system of equations to represent the given information. Let x be the cost of one soda and y be the cost of one energy bar. Then we have:

1x + 2y = 150 (equation 1)
2x + 3y = 300 (equation 2)

We can solve for x and y by using elimination or substitution. Let's use elimination:

Multiply equation 1 by 2:

2x + 4y = 300 (equation 3)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 3:

2x + 4y - (2x + 3y) = 300 - 300

y = 0

Now we can substitute y = 0 into either equation 1 or 2 to solve for x:

1x + 2(0) = 150

x = 150

So one soda costs 150 cents and one energy bar costs 0 cents (which doesn't make sense, but it's what we got from the equations).

Now we can use this information to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:

6x + 7y = 6(150) + 7(0) =

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the value of x in terms of y. We know that x is m percent of 4y, so we can write:

x = (m/100) * 4y

Simplifying this expression, we get:

x = (2m/50) * 4y
x = (m/25) * 4y
x = (4m/25) * y

Now, we need to find what percentage of x is m in terms of y. We can write:

(m/x) * 100 = (m / (4m/25)y) * 100
(m/x) * 100 = (25/4) * (m/y) * 100
(m/x) * 100 = 625/y

After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract? Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the fraction of the job that each painter can complete in one day. 

Mr. Brown can paint 1/6 of a house in one day. 
Mr. Black can paint 1/8 of a house in one day. 
Mr. Blue can paint 1/12 of a house in one day. 

Together, they can paint 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 7/24 of a house in one day. 

After 8 days, Mr. Brown has completed 8 x 1/6 = 4/3 of a house. 
Mr. Black has completed 8 x 1/8 = 1 house. 

Together, they have completed 4/3 + 1 = 7/3 of a house. 

This means that there is still 2 1/3 houses left to paint. 

Now, Mr. Black will work for 6 more days. In those 6 days, he can paint 6 x 1/8 = 3/4 of a house. 

Together, they have now completed 7/3 + 3/4 = 19/12 of a house. 

This means that 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 11.

Q: Add: +45 and -30 Answer Choices: (A) -30 (B) +30 (C) 0 (D) 15 (E) -15
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to add +45 and -30. 

+45 + (-30) 

To add these two numbers, we can simply add their absolute values and then apply the sign of the larger number. 

45 + 30 = 75 

Since 45 is positive and 30 is negative, the answer will be negative. Therefore, the answer is -75. 

So the correct answer is (E) -15.

Q: Professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest. What was the rate of interest per annum? Answer Choices: (A) 2% (B) 8% (C) 5% (D) 10% (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Given, the principal amount (P) = Rs. 5000, time (t) = 3 years, and simple interest (I) = Rs. 300.

We know that the formula for simple interest is I = (P * R * t) / 100, where R is the rate of interest per annum.

Substituting the given values, we get:

300 = (5000 * R * 3) / 100

Simplifying this equation, we get:

R = (300 * 100) / (5000 * 3)

R = 2%

Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 2%, which is option (A). 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (A) 2%.

Q: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? Answer Choices: (A) 8.5 (B) 10.5 (C) 12.5 (D) 14.5 (E) 16.5
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that one gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. 

Let's call the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E "E" and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A "A". 

So, one gram of the health food contains 0.09E of vitamin E and 0.08A of vitamin A. 

To find out how many grams of the health food we need to eat daily to get at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to set up an equation. 

We want to find "x", the number of grams of the health food we need to eat daily. 

0.09E(x) + 0.08A(x) >= E + A 

This equation says that the total amount of vitamin E and vitamin A we get from "x" grams of the health food must be greater than or equal to the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. 

Now we can plug in the values we know: 

0.09E(x) + 0.08A(x) >= E + A 

0.09(0.01x) +  
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is We need to continue solving the equation we set up earlier: 

0.09E(x) + 0.08A(x) >= E + A

Q: Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that at least 45% of 200 students attended the prom night, which means:

45% of 200 = 0.45 x 200 = 90 students attended the prom night

Similarly, we know that at least 35% of 200 students took part in the debating session, which means:

35% of 200 = 0.35 x 200 = 70 students took part in the debating session

Now, we need to find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session. To do this, we need to subtract the number of students who attended the prom night and the number of students who took part in the debating session from the total number of students:

Total number of students = 200

Number of students who attended the prom night = 90

Number of students who took part in the debating session = 70

Maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session = Total number of students - Number of students who attended the prom night - Number of students who took part in the debating session

= 200 - 90 - 70

= 40

Therefore, the maximum number of students

Q: A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the field. Since we are not given the dimensions of the field, we cannot directly calculate the area. However, we know that the cow can graze up to 10 sq.ft. per day, so we can use this information to estimate the area.

If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then in 1 day it can graze a circle with a radius of 14 feet (the length of the rope). The area of this circle is:

A = πr^2
A = π(14)^2
A ≈ 615.75 sq.ft.

So, we can estimate that the cow can graze about 616 sq.ft. per day.

Next, we need to find the total area of the field. Let's assume that the field is circular (since we are given the length of the rope, which suggests a circular area). The area of a circle is:

A = πr^2

We know that the radius of the circle is 14 feet (the length of the rope), so:

A = π(14)^2
A ≈ 615.75 sq.ft.

So, the total area of the field is approximately 616 sq.ft 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (D) 81 days, since the cow can graze approximately 616 sq.ft. per day and the total area of the field is approximately 50,

Q: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much each son will receive when they turn 26 years old. We know that the amount invested for each son will grow at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum for 2 years (from their current age to age 26). 

Using the formula for compound interest, we can calculate the amount each son will receive at age 26:

Amount = Principal * (1 + Rate/100)^Time

For Mohan: 
Principal = Mohan's share
Rate = 4%
Time = 2 years

Amount received by Mohan at age 26 = Mohan's share * (1 + 4/100)^2

For Sohan: 
Principal = Sohan's share
Rate = 4%
Time = 2 years

Amount received by Sohan at age 26 = Sohan's share * (1 + 4/100)^2

Since the father wants both sons to receive equal amounts at age 26, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:

Mohan's share * (1 + 4/100)^2 = Sohan's share * (1 + 4/100)^2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Mohan's

Q: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that the coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. Let's assume that she brought x copper coins and y brass coins.

So, the total amount she earned from copper coins would be 20x cents and the total amount she earned from brass coins would be 25y cents.

We also know that after one dive, she earned $3.40. This can be written as 340 cents.

So, we can set up an equation:

20x + 25y = 340

Now, we need to find the minimum number of copper coins she brought. To do this, we can use the answer choices given.

Let's start with answer choice (A) 4 copper coins. If she brought 4 copper coins, then she must have brought (340 - 20(4)) / 25 = 8 brass coins.

Plugging these values into our equation, we get:

20(4) + 25(8) = 340

This is true, so (A) is a possible answer.

Now, let's try answer choice (B) 3 copper coins. If she brought 3 copper coins, then

Q: The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 12% (C) 6% (D) 8% (E) 4%
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume that the rate of interest is 'r'. 

Simple Interest (SI) for 2 years = (5000 * r * 2)/100 = 100r

Compound Interest (CI) for 2 years = 5000 * [(1 + r/100)^2 - 1]

Difference between CI and SI = CI - SI = 5000 * [(1 + r/100)^2 - 1] - 100r

Given that the difference between CI and SI is Rs. 72.

So, 5000 * [(1 + r/100)^2 - 1] - 100r = 72

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

(1 + r/100)^2 - 1 - 100r/5000 = 0.0144

(1 + r/100)^2 - 1 - 0.0144 = 100r/5000

(1 + r/100)^2 = 1.0144 + 100r/5000

Taking square root on both sides, we get:

1 + r/100 = sqrt(1.0144 + 100r/500

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we know that Jill needed 10 bottles of soda for a party with 8 people. So, on average, each person drank 10/8 = 1.25 bottles of soda.

Now, we need to figure out how many bottles of soda Jill will need for a party with 12 people. If each person drinks an average of 1.25 bottles of soda, then for 12 people, Jill will need 12 x 1.25 = 15 bottles of soda.

However, the answer choices don't include 15, so we need to round to the nearest option. The closest option is (E) 14, which is only one bottle less than what we calculated. So, the answer is (E) 14.

Q: A special cereal mixture contains rice, wheat and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, how much corn does it contain? Answer Choices: (A) 6.5 (B) 7.5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) None of the above
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Given that the ratio of rice, wheat, and corn in the mixture is 2:3:5.

Let's assume that the bag of the mixture contains 2x pounds of rice, 3x pounds of wheat, and 5x pounds of corn.

We know that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice. So, we can write the following equation:

2x = 3

Solving for x, we get:

x = 3/2

Now, we can find the amount of corn in the bag by multiplying the amount of corn per unit of rice by the amount of rice in the bag.

The amount of corn per unit of rice is 5/2 (since the ratio of corn to rice is 5:2).

So, the amount of corn in the bag is:

5/2 * 3 = 7.5

Therefore, the answer is (B) 7.5. 
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 7.5.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

(272 - 32) (124 + 176) = 240 x 300

Next, we need to simplify the expression in the denominator:

17 x 15 - 15 = 240 - 15 = 225

Now we can substitute these values into the original expression:

[(240 x 300) / 225] = 320

Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. 

We know that Train A leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, running at the speed of 40 kmph. This means that by the time Train B starts at 2 pm, Train A has already covered a distance of 120 km (since it has been running for 3 hours at 40 kmph). 

Now, let's consider the time when the two trains meet each other. Let's say they meet after t hours of Train B's journey. 

In that time, Train A would have covered a distance of 40t km (since it is still running at 40 kmph) and Train B would have covered a distance of 72(t-2) km (since it started 2 hours later and is running at 72 kmph). 

We know that the two trains meet each other at some point, which means that the distance covered by Train A and Train B must add up to the total distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow. This distance is 1385 km. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

40t + 72(t-2) = 1385 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

112t =

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's start by finding the volume of the cube and the sphere. 

Let's assume that the side length of the cube is "a". Therefore, the volume of the cube will be a^3. 

Now, let's find the volume of the sphere that can fit inside the cube. The diameter of the sphere will be equal to the side length of the cube. Therefore, the radius of the sphere will be a/2. 

The volume of the sphere is given by the formula (4/3)πr^3. Substituting the value of r, we get the volume of the sphere as (4/3)π(a/2)^3 = (1/6)πa^3. 

Now, let's find the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere. 

Ratio = Volume of Cube : Volume of Sphere 
      = a^3 : (1/6)πa^3 
      = 6 : π

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we need to find the total number of sweets in the bag. We know that the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, which means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. 

Since we know that there are 120 green sweets, we can set up a proportion:

3/4 = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

4x = 3 * 120

4x = 360

x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.
