Q: Shannon and her family use up a lot of strawberry and blueberry jelly , since they eat toast every morning . At the moment , they have a combined total of 6310 grams of jelly . If they have 4518 grams of blueberry jelly , how many grams of strawberry jelly do they have ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that Shannon and her family have a combined total of 6310 grams of jelly.

We also know that they have 4518 grams of blueberry jelly.

To find out how many grams of strawberry jelly they have, we can subtract the amount of blueberry jelly from the total amount of jelly:

6310 grams - 4518 grams = 1792 grams

Therefore, Shannon and her family have 1792 grams of strawberry jelly. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1792 grams.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to add up the weights of all three rings. 

0.08333333333333333 + 0.3333333333333333 + 0.4166666666666667 = 0.8333333333333333 

So the total weight of the plastic rings is 0.8333333333333333 ounces. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.8333333333333333 ounces.

Q: Melanie bought a Batman game for $ 6.95 , a strategy game for $ 7.90 , and a Superman game for $ 7.73 . Melanie already owns 4 games . How much did Melanie spend on video games ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

Melanie bought three games: Batman, strategy, and Superman. 

The cost of Batman game is $6.95. 

The cost of strategy game is $7.90. 

The cost of Superman game is $7.73. 

So, the total cost of the three games is:

$6.95 + $7.90 + $7.73 = $22.58

Melanie already owns 4 games, so we need to add the cost of the three games to the cost of the four games she already owns:

$22.58 + cost of 4 games she already owns

We don't know the cost of the four games she already owns, so we can't calculate the total cost of all the games. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $22.58 + cost of 4 games she already owns.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add up the fractions of tarts filled with each type of fruit:

0.08333333333333333 (cherries) + 0.75 (blueberries) + 0.08333333333333333 (peaches) = 0.9166666666666666

This means that the restaurant had 0.9166666666666666 of a tart left over in total. However, we want to know how many whole tarts they had left over, so we need to round this number to the nearest whole number. 

Since the decimal part is less than 0.5, we can round down to 0. Therefore, the restaurant had 0 whole tarts left over. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.

Q: There were a total of 8 football games this year , 4 are played at night . Keith missed 4 of the games . How many football games did Keith go to in total ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many games Keith did not miss. 

We know that there were a total of 8 games, and Keith missed 4 of them. So, he must have gone to 8 - 4 = 4 games. 

However, we also know that 4 of the games were played at night. We don't know if Keith missed any of the night games, but we do know that he went to all of the day games. 

So, the total number of games that Keith went to is 4 (the number of day games) plus the number of night games that he attended. We don't know how many night games he attended, but we do know that it's less than or equal to 4 (since he missed 4 games in total). 

Therefore, the answer is: Keith went to at least 4 games, and at most 8 games (if he attended all of the night games).

Q: Benny received 67 dollars for his birthday . He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove , baseball , and bat . He had 33 dollars over , how much did he spent on the baseball gear ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much Benny spent in total. We know he received 67 dollars for his birthday and had 33 dollars left over, so he spent:

67 - 33 = 34 dollars

Next, we need to figure out how much he spent on the baseball gear. We don't have that information directly, but we know that the total amount he spent was 34 dollars and that he bought a baseball glove, baseball, and bat. So we can set up an equation:

Cost of baseball gear = Total amount spent - Cost of other items

Cost of baseball gear = 34 - (cost of baseball glove + cost of baseball + cost of bat)

We don't know the individual costs of the items, but we do know that Benny bought all three items at a sporting goods store. Based on typical prices for these items, we can estimate that:

- A baseball glove costs around 20-30 dollars
- A baseball costs around 5-10 dollars
- A bat costs around 20-40 dollars

So we can make some educated guesses about the costs of the items and plug them into the equation:

Cost of baseball gear = 34 - (25 + 7 + 30)

Cost of baseball gear =  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Cost of baseball gear = 34 - 62 = -28 dollars

This doesn't make sense - it means that Benny spent more on the baseball gear than
pred_before :  Cost of baseball gear = 34 - 62 = -28 dollars

This doesn't make sense - it means that Benny spent more on the baseball gear than

Q: There were 2 red orchids and 4 white orchids in the vase . Jessica cut some red orchids from her flower garden . There are now 18 red orchids in the vase . How many red orchids did she cut ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red orchids were in the vase before Jessica cut some. We know that there were originally 2 red orchids in the vase, so we can subtract that from the total number of red orchids in the vase now:

18 - 2 = 16

So there are 16 red orchids that Jessica added to the vase. But we want to know how many she cut from her garden. To find out, we can subtract the original number of red orchids from the number she added:

16 - x = number of red orchids Jessica cut

where x is the number of red orchids she cut. To solve for x, we can rearrange the equation:

x = 16 - (number of red orchids Jessica added)

We know that Jessica added some red orchids to the vase, but we don't know how many. However, we do know that the total number of orchids in the vase increased from 6 to 18, so Jessica must have added:

18 - 6 = 12

orchids in total. Since we know that 16 of those were red, we can subtract that from the total number of orchids she added to find out how many were white:

12 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4. 

So, Jessica cut 16 - 4 = 12 red orchids from her garden.

Jason's original number of Pokemon cards = 3

Next, we need to subtract the 2 Pokemon cards that Benny bought from Jason's original number of cards:

Jason's new number of Pokemon cards = Jason's original number of Pokemon cards - Pokemon cards Benny bought
Jason's new number of Pokemon cards = 3 - 2
Jason's new number of Pokemon cards = 1

Therefore, Jason now has 1 Pokemon card after Benny bought 2 of his cards.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the difference between the heights of the two sandcastles. To do this, we can subtract the height of Miki's sandcastle from the height of her sister's sandcastle:

0.5 - 0.8333333333333334 = -0.3333333333333334

The result is negative, which means that Miki's sister's sandcastle is actually taller than Miki's sandcastle. 

To find the absolute difference between the two heights, we can take the absolute value of the result:

| -0.3333333333333334 | = 0.3333333333333334

So the height difference between the two sandcastles is 0.3333333333333334 feet. Therefore, Miki's sandcastle is 0.3333333333333334 feet taller than her sister's sandcastle.

Q: Joan grew 24 pumpkins , Keith grew 42 pumpkins , and Alyssa grew 13 pumpkins . They worked for 34 days on the farm . How many pumpkins did they grow in all ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pumpkins each person grew. 

Joan grew 24 pumpkins, Keith grew 42 pumpkins, and Alyssa grew 13 pumpkins. 

So, the total number of pumpkins they grew is: 

24 + 42 + 13 = 79 pumpkins 

Next, we need to find out how many pumpkins they grew per day. 

To do this, we divide the total number of pumpkins by the number of days they worked: 

79 / 34 = 2.32 pumpkins per day 

Finally, we need to find out how many pumpkins they grew in all. 

To do this, we multiply the number of pumpkins they grew per day by the number of days they worked: 

2.32 x 34 = 78.88 

So, they grew a total of approximately 78.88 pumpkins in all. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 79 pumpkins.

Q: Tim found 37 seashells and Sally found 13 seashells on the beach . When they cleaned them , they discovered that 25 were cracked . How many seashells did they find together ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of seashells they found together before cleaning them. To do this, we can add the number of seashells Tim found to the number of seashells Sally found:

37 + 13 = 50

So, they found 50 seashells together.

Next, we need to subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells they found together to get the number of seashells that were not cracked:

50 - 25 = 25

Therefore, they found 25 seashells that were not cracked.

Overall, they found a total of 50 seashells together. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 50.

Q: Dan 's cat had kittens and 5 had spots . He gave 7 to Tim and 4 to Jason . He now has 5 kittens . How many kittens did he have to start with ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Dan had some number of kittens before giving any away. Let's call that number "x".

Next, we know that 5 of those kittens had spots, so the remaining kittens must have been x - 5.

Dan gave 7 kittens to Tim and 4 kittens to Jason, so he gave away a total of 7 + 4 = 11 kittens.

That means he must have had 11 more kittens before giving any away, so his original number of kittens was x + 11.

Finally, we know that he now has 5 kittens, so we can set up an equation:

x + 11 - 11 = 5

Simplifying, we get:

x = 5

So Dan originally had 5 + 11 = 16 kittens. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 16.

Q: There were 9 red orchids and 3 white orchids in the vase . Sally cut some red orchids from her flower garden . There are now 15 red orchids in the vase . How many red orchids did she cut ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many red orchids Sally had before she cut any. We know that there were originally 9 red orchids in the vase, so Sally must have had some additional red orchids to add to the vase. Let's call the number of red orchids Sally had before she cut any "x".

So, the total number of red orchids in the vase before Sally cut any is 9 + x.

Next, we know that Sally cut some red orchids from her garden. Let's call the number of red orchids she cut "y". So now, the total number of red orchids in the vase is 15 (the number given in the problem).

Putting it all together, we can set up an equation:

9 + x - y = 15

We want to solve for "y", so we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. First, we can simplify the left side by combining the "9" and "x":

x + 9 - y = 15

Next, we can subtract "9" from both sides:

x - y = 6

Finally, we can add "y" to both sides to isolate it:

x = 6 + y

So Sally 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is y = 6. Sally cut 6 red orchids from her garden.

First, we need to find the fraction of students who received A's. We know that 0.7 of the students received A's, which can also be written as 7/10.

Next, we need to find the fraction of students who received B's. We know that 0.2 of the students received B's, which can also be written as 2/10 or 1/5.

To find the fraction of students who received either A's or B's, we need to add the fractions of students who received A's and B's. So, 7/10 + 1/5 = 14/20 + 4/20 = 18/20.

Therefore, the fraction of students who received either A's or B's is 18/20, which can be simplified to 9/10.

Q: So far , an orchard has sold a combined total of 9792 pounds of fresh and frozen fruit this season . If they have sold 3513 pounds of frozen fruit , how many pounds of fresh fruit have been sold so far ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume the total weight of fresh fruit sold so far is 'x' pounds.

Then, the combined weight of fresh and frozen fruit sold is the sum of the weight of fresh fruit and the weight of frozen fruit, which is:

x + 3513

According to the problem, the combined weight of fresh and frozen fruit sold so far is 9792 pounds. So we can set up an equation:

x + 3513 = 9792

Now we can solve for 'x':

x = 9792 - 3513

x = 6279

Therefore, the orchard has sold 6279 pounds of fresh fruit so far. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6279.

We know that there are currently 4 walnut trees in the park. 

The park workers will plant 6 more walnut trees today. 

To find out how many walnut trees the park will have when the workers are finished, we need to add the number of trees currently in the park to the number of trees the workers will plant today. 

So, the total number of walnut trees in the park after the workers are finished planting will be:

4 (current trees) + 6 (newly planted trees) = 10

Therefore, the park will have 10 walnut trees when the workers are finished planting. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 10.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of yellow balloons. We can do this by adding the number of yellow balloons each person has:

5 + 6 + 7 = 18

So, they have a total of 18 yellow balloons.

Next, we need to find the cost of the balloons. We know that the cost is $5, so we can divide $5 by the total number of balloons to find the cost per balloon:

$5 ÷ 18 balloons = $0.28 per balloon

Therefore, each yellow balloon costs $0.28.

Finally, we can confirm our answer by multiplying the cost per balloon by the total number of balloons:

$0.28 × 18 balloons = $5.04

So, the total cost of the balloons is $5.04, which is close to the original cost of $5. This confirms that our answer is correct.

Q: A ship full of grain crashes into a coral reef . By the time the ship is fixed , 49952 tons of grain have spilled into the water . Only 918 tons of grain remain onboard . How many tons of grain did the ship originally contain ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

Let's assume that the ship originally contained x tons of grain.

After the accident, 49952 tons of grain spilled into the water, so the remaining amount of grain on the ship is:

x - 49952

But we also know that only 918 tons of grain remain onboard, so we can set up an equation:

x - 49952 = 918

Now we can solve for x:

x = 49952 + 918
x = 50870

Therefore, the ship originally contained 50870 tons of grain. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 50870.

$12.32 - $3 = $9.32 

So Sally paid $9.32 for the peaches. 

Next, we need to add that amount to the $11.54 she paid for the cherries. 

$9.32 + $11.54 = $20.86 

Therefore, Sally spent a total of $20.86.

Next, we need to find out how much more flour she needs to add. The recipe calls for a total of 8 cups of flour, and she has already put in 4 cups. 

To find out how much more flour she needs to add, we can subtract the amount she has already put in from the total amount called for in the recipe: 

8 cups - 4 cups = 4 cups 

So Jessica needs to add 4 more cups of flour to the cake.

We know that 0.25 of the nails are size 2d and 0.5 of the nails are size 4d. 

To find the fraction of nails that are either size 2d or 4d, we need to add these two fractions together. 

So, the fraction of nails that are size 2d is 0.25, which can also be written as 1/4. 

The fraction of nails that are size 4d is 0.5, which can also be written as 1/2. 

To find the fraction of nails that are either size 2d or 4d, we add these two fractions together: 

1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 

Therefore, 3/4 of the nails are either size 2d or 4d.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add the fractions 0.5 and 0.125 to find the total fraction of students in either the trumpet or trombone section:

0.5 + 0.125 = 0.625

So, 0.625 of the students in the band are in either the trumpet or trombone section. 

However, we can simplify this fraction by finding a common denominator and then adding the numerators:

0.5 = 0.500/1 and 0.125 = 0.125/1

To find a common denominator, we can multiply 1 by 1000 to get:

0.500/1 = 500/1000 and 0.125/1 = 125/1000

Now we can add the numerators:

500/1000 + 125/1000 = 625/1000

So, the simplified fraction is 625/1000, which can be further simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 125:

625/1000 = (625/125) / (1000/125) = 5/8

Therefore, 5/8 of the students in the band are in either the trumpet or trombone section.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bales of hay Jason added to the barn. We can do this by subtracting the original number of bales in the barn from the current number of bales in the barn:

98 - 32 = 66

So Jason added 66 bales of hay to the barn.

Next, we need to figure out how many bales of hay are left in the shed. We can do this by subtracting the number of bales Jason added to the barn from the original number of bales in the shed:

26 - 66 = -40

Uh oh, we got a negative number! This means that there are no bales of hay left in the shed. We can double check our answer by adding the number of bales in the barn and the shed:

32 + 26 = 58

And then adding the number of bales Jason added to the barn:

58 + 66 = 124

So there should be a total of 124 bales of hay, which matches the current number of bales in the barn. Therefore, our answer is that Jason stored 66 bales of hay in the barn. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 66.

14 - 3 = 11

So, Alyssa added 11 roses to the vase.

To find out how many roses she cut from her garden, we can subtract the number of roses she added from the number of roses she had before cutting:

x - 11 = 3

Here, x represents the initial number of roses in Alyssa's garden. To solve for x, we can add 11 to both sides of the equation:

x = 14

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total distance Craig traveled, which is the sum of the distance he rode on the bus and the distance he walked. 

Total distance = distance on bus + distance walked
Total distance = 3.8333333333333335 miles + 0.16666666666666666 mile
Total distance = 4 miles

Next, we need to find how much farther Craig rode than walked. 

Difference = distance on bus - distance walked
Difference = 3.8333333333333335 miles - 0.16666666666666666 mile
Difference = 3.6666666666666665 miles

We know that the Richmond Tigers sold a total of 9570 tickets last season. We also know that they sold 3867 tickets in the first half of the season. 

To find out how many tickets they sold in the second half of the season, we can use subtraction. 

We can subtract the number of tickets sold in the first half of the season from the total number of tickets sold in the season. 

So, 

Number of tickets sold in the second half of the season = Total number of tickets sold - Number of tickets sold in the first half of the season 

Number of tickets sold in the second half of the season = 9570 - 3867 

Number of tickets sold in the second half of the season = 5703 

Therefore, the Richmond Tigers sold 5703 tickets in the second half of the season.

First, we know that Sally had 760 quarters in her bank.

Next, we know that she spent 418 of those quarters.

To find out how many quarters she has now, we need to subtract the number of quarters she spent from the number of quarters she had originally.

So, the equation would be:

760 - 418 = ?

Simplifying this equation, we get:

342 quarters

Therefore, Sally has 342 quarters left in her bank. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 342.

Q: Alyssa 's dog had puppies . She gave 7 to her friends . She now has 5 puppies . How many puppies did she have to start with ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Alyssa gave 7 puppies to her friends. So, if she had x puppies to start with, she would have x - 7 puppies left after giving away 7.

Next, we know that she now has 5 puppies. So, we can set up an equation:

x - 7 = 5

To solve for x, we can add 7 to both sides:

x - 7 + 7 = 5 + 7

Simplifying:

x = 12

Therefore, Alyssa had 12 puppies to start with. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much gas Michelle had left in her car when she returned to the pizzeria. We know that she started with 0.5 tank of gas and ended with 0.16666666666666666 tank of gas, so we can subtract the two to find out how much gas she used:

0.5 - 0.16666666666666666 = 0.3333333333333333

So Michelle used 0.3333333333333333 tank of gas on her pizza delivery route.

Q: Nancy grew 2 onions , Dan grew 9 onions , and Mike grew 4 onions . They worked for 6 days on the farm . How many onions did they grow in total ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find the total number of onions each person grew. 

Nancy grew 2 onions, Dan grew 9 onions, and Mike grew 4 onions. 

So, the total number of onions they grew is: 

2 + 9 + 4 = 15 onions 

Next, we need to find out how many onions they grew per day. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of onions by the number of days they worked: 

15 onions / 6 days = 2.5 onions per day 

So, on average, they grew 2.5 onions per day. 

Therefore, over the course of 6 days, they grew: 

2.5 onions per day x 6 days = 15 onions 

So, in total, they grew 15 onions. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 15.

To do this, we can subtract 24 from 39: 

39 - 24 = 15 

So Sally has 15 baseball cards left after selling 24 to Sara. 

Next, we need to find out how many of those 15 cards are torn. 

We know that 9 of the original 39 cards were torn, so we can subtract 9 from 15: 

15 - 9 = 6 

So Sally has 6 untorn baseball cards left. 

Therefore, Sally has a total of 6 + 9 = 15 torn and untorn baseball cards left. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 15.

$1.08 + $4.80 = $5.88

So the total cost of Mary's lunch was $5.88.

Next, we need to figure out how much change Mary should receive from her $20 bill. To do this, we can subtract the total cost of the lunch from the amount of money Mary paid:

$20.00 - $5.88 = $14.12

So Mary should receive $14.12 in change.

Q: During a canned food drive , items were sorted into bins . The drive resulted in 0.125 bin of soup , 0.125 bin of vegetables , and 0.5 bin of pasta . Altogether , how many bins would the canned food take up ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's start by adding up the fractions of bins for each type of canned food. 

0.125 bin of soup + 0.125 bin of vegetables + 0.5 bin of pasta = 

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The smallest common denominator for 8, 8, and 2 is 8. 

0.125 bin of soup can be written as 1/8 bin of soup (since 0.125 = 1/8)
0.125 bin of vegetables can also be written as 1/8 bin of vegetables
0.5 bin of pasta can be written as 4/8 bin of pasta (since 0.5 = 1/2 = 4/8)

Now we can add the fractions: 

1/8 bin of soup + 1/8 bin of vegetables + 4/8 bin of pasta = 

To simplify the fraction, we can add the numerators and keep the denominator: 

1/8 + 1/8 + 4/8 = 6/8 

So the canned food would take up 6/8 of a bin. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3/4 bin.

Q: Sam had 9 dimes in his bank . His dad gave him 7 dimes . How many dimes does Sam have now ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add the number of dimes Sam had before and the number of dimes his dad gave him. 

9 dimes (Sam's original amount) + 7 dimes (his dad gave him) = 16 dimes 

So Sam now has 16 dimes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 16.

Q: Fred went to 36 basketball games this year , but missed 35 . He went to 11 games last year . How many basketball games did Fred go to in total ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many basketball games Fred went to this year. We know he went to 36 games, but missed 35, so the total number of games he attended this year is:

36 - 35 = 1 game

Next, we need to add this to the number of games he attended last year, which was 11. So the total number of games Fred went to is:

1 + 11 = 12 games

Therefore, Fred went to a total of 12 basketball games. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12.

Q: Jason had Pokemon cards . He gave 9 to his friends . He now has 4 Pokemon cards . How many Pokemon cards did he have to start with ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jason gave away 9 Pokemon cards to his friends. So, we can subtract 9 from his original number of cards to find out how many he had before giving any away. 

Let's use "x" to represent the original number of cards: 

x - 9 = number of cards after giving 9 away 

Next, we know that Jason now has 4 Pokemon cards. So we can set up another equation: 

x - 9 = 4 

Now we can solve for x by adding 9 to both sides of the equation: 

x - 9 + 9 = 4 + 9 

x = 13 

Therefore, Jason had 13 Pokemon cards to start with. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 13.

Q: It rained 0.9 inches on Monday . On Tuesday , it rained 0.7 inches less than on Monday . How much did it rain on Tuesday ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that it rained 0.9 inches on Monday. 

Next, we need to figure out how much it rained on Tuesday. We know that it rained 0.7 inches less than on Monday. 

To find out how much it rained on Tuesday, we can subtract 0.7 from 0.9: 

0.9 - 0.7 = 0.2 

So it rained 0.2 inches on Tuesday. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.2 inches.

Q: Marta picked 2 pumpkins . The first pumpkin weighed 4 pounds , and the second pumpkin weighed 8.7 pounds . How much did the 2 pumpkins weigh all together ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to add the weight of the first pumpkin and the weight of the second pumpkin. 

Weight of the first pumpkin = 4 pounds 

Weight of the second pumpkin = 8.7 pounds 

Total weight of the two pumpkins = 4 + 8.7 

= 12.7 pounds 

Therefore, the two pumpkins weighed 12.7 pounds all together. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12.7 pounds.

Q: There are 6 short bushes and 4 tall trees currently in the park . Park workers had to cut down 2 short bushes that were damaged . How many short bushes will the park have when the workers are finished ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we start with the total number of short bushes and tall trees in the park, which is 6 + 4 = 10.

Next, we know that 2 short bushes were cut down, so we subtract 2 from the original number of short bushes: 6 - 2 = 4.

Therefore, the park will have 4 short bushes when the workers are finished. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

Q: While taking inventory at her pastry shop , Kelly realizes that she had 0.4 box of baking powder yesterday , but the supply is now down to 0.3 box . How much more baking powder did Kelly have yesterday ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that Kelly had 0.4 box of baking powder yesterday, and the supply is now down to 0.3 box. So, we need to find the difference between these two quantities to determine how much more baking powder Kelly had yesterday.

To do this, we can subtract 0.3 from 0.4:

0.4 - 0.3 = 0.1

Therefore, Kelly had 0.1 more box of baking powder yesterday than she has now. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.1 box.
pred_before :  0.1 box.

Q: Last week Tom had 74 dollars . He washed cars over the weekend and now has 86 dollars . How much money did he make washing cars ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

Tom had 74 dollars last week. 

After washing cars over the weekend, he now has 86 dollars. 

To find out how much money he made washing cars, we can subtract his initial amount from his final amount: 

86 - 74 = 12 

Therefore, Tom made 12 dollars washing cars over the weekend. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12.

Q: Sally had 8 pennies and 7 nickels in her bank . Her dad gave her 9 nickels and her mother gave her 2 nickels . How many nickels does Sally have now ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many nickels Sally had before her dad and mom gave her more. 

Sally had 7 nickels to start with. 

Her dad gave her 9 more nickels, so now she has 7 + 9 = 16 nickels. 

Her mom gave her 2 more nickels, so now she has 16 + 2 = 18 nickels. 

Therefore, Sally now has 18 nickels. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 18.

Q: A chef bought 0.14 kilograms of almonds and 0.38 kilograms of pecans . How many kilograms of nuts did the chef buy in all ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to add the weight of the almonds and pecans together. 

0.14 kg (almonds) + 0.38 kg (pecans) = 0.52 kg 

So the chef bought a total of 0.52 kilograms of nuts. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.52 kilograms.
pred_before :  0.52 kilograms.

Q: Sara 's high school played 12 basketball games this year . The team won most of their games . They were defeated during 4 games . How many games did they win ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together. 

We know that Sara's high school played 12 basketball games this year. 

We also know that they were defeated during 4 games. 

To find out how many games they won, we can subtract the number of games they lost from the total number of games played: 

12 - 4 = 8 

Therefore, they won 8 games. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

Q: Wendy ran 19.833333333333332 miles and walked 9.166666666666666 miles . How much farther did Wendy run than walk ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find the difference between the distance Wendy ran and walked. 

To do this, we can subtract the distance she walked from the distance she ran: 

19.833333333333332 - 9.166666666666666 = 10.666666666666666 

So Wendy ran 10.666666666666666 miles farther than she walked. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 10.666666666666666 miles.

Q: Joan had 5 dimes in her bank . She spent 2 of her dimes . How many dimes does she have now ?
A: Let's think step by step. Joan had 5 dimes in her bank. She spent 2 of her dimes. 

To find out how many dimes she has now, we can subtract the number of dimes she spent from the number of dimes she had originally. 

So, 5 - 2 = 3 

Therefore, Joan has 3 dimes now. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: Each of farmer Cunningham 's 6048 lambs is either black or white . There are 193 white ones . How many of Farmer Cunningham 's lambs are black ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. 

Step 1: Write down the given information. 

- Total number of lambs = 6048
- Number of white lambs = 193

Step 2: Find the number of black lambs. 

To find the number of black lambs, we need to subtract the number of white lambs from the total number of lambs. 

Number of black lambs = Total number of lambs - Number of white lambs
Number of black lambs = 6048 - 193
Number of black lambs = 5855

Therefore, there are 5855 black lambs on Farmer Cunningham's farm. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5855.

Q: Dan spent $ 11.76 on a snake toy , and a cage cost him $ 14.54 . Dan also found a dollar bill on the ground . What was the total cost of Dan 's purchases ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Dan spent $11.76 on a snake toy.

Next, we know that he spent $14.54 on a cage.

Finally, we know that he found a dollar bill on the ground.

To find the total cost of Dan's purchases, we need to add up the cost of the snake toy, the cage, and the dollar bill he found.

So, the total cost would be:

$11.76 (snake toy) + $14.54 (cage) + $1 (dollar bill found) = $27.30

Therefore, the total cost of Dan's purchases was $27.30. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $27.30.

Q: Sally had 13 peaches at her roadside fruit dish . She went to the orchard and picked peaches to stock up . There are now 55 peaches . how many did she pick ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many peaches Sally picked. To do that, we can subtract the number of peaches she had originally from the number of peaches she has now:

55 - 13 = 42

Therefore, Sally picked 42 peaches from the orchard to stock up her fruit dish. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 42.

Q: Joan has 47 green and 48 red marbles . Fred took 24 of Joan 's green marbles . How many green marbles does Joan now have ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many green marbles Joan had before Fred took 24 of them. 

Joan had 47 green marbles, and Fred took 24 of them, so we can subtract 24 from 47: 

47 - 24 = 23 

So Joan now has 23 green marbles. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 23.

Q: A truck carrying 4.1 pounds of sand travels to a construction yard and loses 2.4 pounds of sand along the way . How much sand does the truck have when it arrives at the yard ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together. 

First, we need to find out how much sand the truck has left after losing 2.4 pounds. 

To do this, we can subtract 2.4 from 4.1: 

4.1 - 2.4 = 1.7 

So the truck has 1.7 pounds of sand left when it arrives at the yard. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.7 pounds.
pred_before :  1.7 pounds.

Q: Jonah added 0.3 cup of yellow raisins and 0.4 cup of black raisins to a batch of trail mix . How many cups of raisins did Jonah add in all ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to add the amount of yellow raisins and black raisins that Jonah added. 

0.3 cups (yellow raisins) + 0.4 cups (black raisins) = 0.7 cups (total raisins)

Therefore, Jonah added 0.7 cups of raisins in all.

Q: Nancy went to 9 football games this month . She went to 8 games last month , and plans to go to 7 games next month . She paid 3 dollars for the tickets . How many games will she attend in all ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can add up the number of games Nancy went to this month, last month, and plans to go to next month: 

9 + 8 + 7 = 24 

So Nancy will attend a total of 24 games. 

Next, we can multiply the total number of games by the cost of each ticket: 

24 x 3 = 72 

So Nancy will spend a total of 72 dollars on tickets for all the games she attends. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 24 games.
pred_before :  24 games.

Q: At the beach , Janet and her sister both built sandcastles and then measured their heights . Janet 's sandcastle was 3.6666666666666665 feet tall and her sister 's was 2.3333333333333335 feet tall . How much taller was Janet 's sandcastle than her sister 's ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find the difference between the heights of the two sandcastles. To do this, we subtract the height of Janet's sister's sandcastle from the height of Janet's sandcastle. 

So, the calculation would be: 

3.6666666666666665 - 2.3333333333333335 = 1.333333333333333 

Therefore, Janet's sandcastle is 1.333333333333333 feet taller than her sister's sandcastle. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.333333333333333 feet.

Q: Sara has 792 black and 122 red marbles . Fred took 233 of Sara 's black marbles . How many black marbles does Sara now have ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many black marbles Sara had before Fred took 233 of them. 

Sara had 792 black marbles. 

Next, we need to subtract the 233 black marbles that Fred took from Sara's original amount. 

792 - 233 = 559 

Therefore, Sara now has 559 black marbles. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 559.

Q: Sara had 24 peaches and 37 pears at her fruit dish . She went to the orchard and picked peaches . There are now 61 peaches . how many did she pick ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many fruits Sara had in total before she went to the orchard. We can do this by adding the number of peaches and pears she had: 

24 peaches + 37 pears = 61 fruits 

So, Sara had 61 fruits in total before she went to the orchard. 

Next, we need to find out how many peaches she had after she went to the orchard. We know that she had 61 fruits in total after picking some peaches, and we also know that she had 24 peaches before she went to the orchard. So, we can subtract the number of peaches she had before from the total number of fruits she had after: 

61 fruits - 24 peaches = 37 peaches 

Therefore, Sara picked 37 peaches from the orchard. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 37.

We know that the blue ball weighs 6 pounds and the brown ball weighs 3.12 pounds. 

To find out what the scale will read when both balls are placed on it, we need to add their weights together. 

So, the total weight of both balls would be:

6 + 3.12 = 9.12 pounds

Q: Christina just transferred $ 69 out of her bank account . As a result , the account now has $ 26935 in it . How much money was in the account before the transfer ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume that the amount of money in Christina's bank account before the transfer was x.

According to the problem statement, Christina transferred $69 out of her bank account. So, the amount of money left in her account after the transfer is (x - 69).

And we are also given that the amount of money left in her account after the transfer is $26935. So, we can write an equation:

x - 69 = 26935

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 69 to both sides of the equation:

x - 69 + 69 = 26935 + 69

Simplifying the left-hand side:

x = 27004

Therefore, the amount of money in Christina's bank account before the transfer was $27004. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $27004.

First, we can add up the amount Joan spent on shorts, jacket, and shirt:

$15 + $14.82 + $12.51 = $42.33

So Joan spent a total of $42.33 on clothing.

Next, we can see that she went to 3 shops. We don't have any information about how much she spent at each shop, so we can't break it down further than the total amount spent.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how much Benny received in total. 

Benny received 79 dollars and 9 movie tickets. We can ignore the movie tickets for now and just focus on the dollars. 

Next, we need to subtract the amount Benny spent on the baseball gear from the amount he had left over. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

Amount Benny spent on baseball gear + 32 dollars = 79 dollars 

To solve for the amount Benny spent on baseball gear, we can subtract 32 from both sides: 

Amount Benny spent on baseball gear = 79 dollars - 32 dollars 

Amount Benny spent on baseball gear = 47 dollars 

Therefore, Benny spent 47 dollars on the baseball gear. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 47.

Q: When Jake had 1 cat , he needed to serve 0.5 can of cat food each day . Now that Jake has adopted a second cat , he needs to serve a total of 0.9 can each day . How much extra food is needed to feed the second cat ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much food Jake was serving to his first cat before he adopted the second one. We know that when he had one cat, he needed to serve 0.5 can of cat food each day. 

Next, we need to figure out how much food he needs to serve now that he has two cats. We know that he needs to serve a total of 0.9 can each day. 

To find out how much extra food is needed to feed the second cat, we can subtract the amount of food he was serving to the first cat from the total amount of food he needs to serve now. 

So, the extra food needed to feed the second cat is:

0.9 - 0.5 = 0.4 can per day. 

Therefore, Jake needs to serve an extra 0.4 can of cat food each day to feed his second cat. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.4.

37 + 25 = 62 

So, a total of 62 orchid bushes will be planted. 

Next, we need to find the total number of orchid bushes in the park after the workers are finished. 

To do this, we add the number of orchid bushes that are currently in the park to the number of orchid bushes that will be planted: 

47 + 62 = 109 

So, the park will have 109 orchid bushes when the workers are finished. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 109.

Q: There were originally 20817 houses in Lincoln County . During a housing boom , developers built 97741 . How many houses are there now in Lincoln County ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together. 

First, we need to find the total number of houses in Lincoln County after the housing boom. To do this, we need to add the original number of houses to the number of houses built during the boom. 

So, we can write:

Total number of houses = Original number of houses + Houses built during the boom

Now, we can substitute the given values:

Total number of houses = 20817 + 97741

We can simplify this by adding the two numbers:

Total number of houses = 118558

Therefore, there are now 118558 houses in Lincoln County. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 118558.

Q: There are 43 maple trees and 22 orange trees currently in the park . Park workers will plant maple trees today . When the workers are finished there will be 54 maple trees in the park . How many maple trees did the workers plant today ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many maple trees are currently in the park. We know that there are 43 maple trees in the park, so:

43 maple trees + X (number of maple trees planted today) = 54 maple trees

To solve for X, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 43 from both sides:

X = 54 maple trees - 43 maple trees
X = 11 maple trees

Therefore, the workers planted 11 maple trees today. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 11.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total area affected by the dust storm. We can do this by subtracting the untouched area from the total area:

Total area affected = 64535 acres - 522 acres
Total area affected = 64013 acres

Now, to find the total area of the prairie, we need to add the untouched area to the total area affected:

Total area of prairie = Total area affected + Untouched area
Total area of prairie = 64013 acres + 522 acres
Total area of prairie = 64535 acres

Therefore, the prairie covers 64535 acres in total. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 64535 acres.
