Q: For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy Megan received. We can do this by adding the number of pieces she received from her neighbors and her sister:

11 + 5 = 16

So Megan received 16 pieces of candy in total.

Next, we need to figure out how many days the candy will last if she only eats 8 pieces a day. We can do this by dividing the total number of pieces by the number of pieces she eats per day:

16 ÷ 8 = 2

So the candy will last Megan 2 days if she only eats 8 pieces a day. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

Q: Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 and her mother picked 15. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of carrots they picked by adding Bianca's and her mother's carrots: 

26 + 15 = 41 

So, they picked a total of 41 carrots. 

Now, we know that only 16 of them were good. To find the number of bad carrots, we can subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots: 

41 - 16 = 25 

Therefore, they had 25 bad carrots. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 25.

Q: Paige and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 4 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Paige recycled 14 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds, how many points did they earn?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find the total weight of paper recycled by Paige and her friends. We can do this by adding the weight of paper recycled by Paige and her friends:

14 pounds + 2 pounds = 16 pounds

Now, we need to find out how many points they earned for recycling 16 pounds of paper. We know that for every 4 pounds of paper recycled, they earn 1 point. So, we can divide the total weight of paper recycled by 4 to find out how many points they earned:

16 pounds ÷ 4 pounds/point = 4 points

Therefore, Paige and her friends earned 4 points for recycling 16 pounds of paper. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

Wendy found 4 treasures on the first level, and each treasure is worth 5 points. So, her score for the first level would be:

4 treasures x 5 points per treasure = 20 points

Next, Wendy found 3 treasures on the second level, and each treasure is worth 5 points. So, her score for the second level would be:

3 treasures x 5 points per treasure = 15 points

To find Wendy's total score, we just need to add up her scores from each level:

20 points (from the first level) + 15 points (from the second level) = 35 points

Therefore, Wendy's score would be 35 points. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 35.

Q: The school cafeteria ordered 6 red apples and 15 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 5 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria, which is 6 + 15 = 21 apples.

Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if only 5 students wanted fruit. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students, which gives us 21 ÷ 5 = 4.2 apples per student.

Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each student would get 4 apples.

Now we can find out how many extra apples the cafeteria has by subtracting the number of apples the students actually took from the total number of apples ordered. If each student took 4 apples, then the total number of apples taken is 4 x 5 = 20 apples.

Therefore, the cafeteria has 21 - 20 = 1 extra apple. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

We need to find out how many 5 dollar toys he can buy with 10 dollars.

To do this, we can divide 10 by 5, since each toy costs 5 dollars.

10 ÷ 5 = 2

Therefore, Paul can buy 2 5-dollar toys with his 10 dollars.

First, we need to find the total number of trays that Victor needs to pick up. 

Total number of trays = 23 + 5 = 28

Next, we need to figure out how many trips Victor will need to make. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Victor can carry in one trip. 

Number of trips = Total number of trays / Number of trays Victor can carry in one trip 

Number of trips = 28 / 7 

Number of trips = 4 

Therefore, Victor will need to make 4 trips to pick up all the trays.

Step 1: Find the total number of pieces of chocolate candy Kaleb bought.
Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy, and each box has 6 pieces inside it. So, the total number of pieces of chocolate candy Kaleb bought is:
14 boxes x 6 pieces per box = 84 pieces

Step 2: Find the number of pieces Kaleb gave to his little brother.
Kaleb gave 5 boxes of chocolate candy to his little brother, and each box has 6 pieces inside it. So, the total number of pieces Kaleb gave to his little brother is:
5 boxes x 6 pieces per box = 30 pieces

Step 3: Find the number of pieces Kaleb still has.
To find the number of pieces Kaleb still has, we need to subtract the number of pieces he gave to his little brother from the total number of pieces he bought:
84 pieces - 30 pieces = 54 pieces

Therefore, Kaleb still has 54 pieces of chocolate candy.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many players left the game. We know that there were 10 friends playing, and 7 players quit, so we can subtract 7 from 10 to find out how many players remained in the game:

10 - 7 = 3

So, there were 3 players left in the game. 

Next, we need to find out how many lives the players who left had. We know that each player who left had 8 lives, so we can multiply 8 by the number of players who left (7) to find out how many lives were lost:

8 x 7 = 56

So, the players who left had a total of 56 lives.

Finally, we can add up the lives of the players who remained in the game and the lives of the players who left to find out the total number of lives:

56 + (8 x 3) = 56 + 24 = 80

Therefore, the players had a total of 80 lives.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of necklaces Faye sold. We know that she sold 3 bead necklaces and 7 gemstone necklaces, so the total number of necklaces sold is:

3 + 7 = 10

Next, we need to find the total amount of money Faye earned. We know that each necklace cost 7 dollars, so the total amount of money earned is:

10 x 7 = 70

Therefore, Faye earned 70 dollars by selling her necklaces at the garage sale. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 70.

Q: There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 5 players quit. If each player left had 5 lives, how many lives did they have total?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many players were left after 5 players quit. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of players who quit from the original number of players: 

8 - 5 = 3 

So, there were 3 players left. 

Next, we need to find out how many lives the players who quit had in total. 

We know that each player who quit had 5 lives, and there were 5 players who quit. 

So, the total number of lives the players who quit had is: 

5 x 5 = 25 

Finally, we can add up the total number of lives: 

25 (lives of players who quit) + 15 (lives of players who didn't quit) = 40 

Therefore, the players had a total of 40 lives. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 40.

Q: Edward made 37 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 21 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 2 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Find out how much money Edward has left after buying new mower blades.
To do this, we need to subtract the cost of new mower blades from the amount of money Edward made mowing lawns.
37 - 21 = 16

Step 2: Determine how many 2 dollar games Edward can buy with the money he has left.
To do this, we need to divide the amount of money Edward has left by the cost of each game.
16 ÷ 2 = 8

Therefore, Edward can buy 8 two-dollar games with the money he has left after buying new mower blades. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Find the total number of cookies Robin has.
To find the total number of cookies, we need to add the number of chocolate chip cookies and oatmeal cookies. 
23 + 25 = 48

Step 2: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag.
We know that Robin has 48 cookies and she wants to put 6 cookies in each bag. So, we need to divide 48 by 6.
48 ÷ 6 = 8

Step 3: Interpret the answer.
The answer is 8, which means Robin can make 8 baggies of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that the cafeteria had 96 apples.
Step 2: They handed out 42 apples to students, so they have 96 - 42 = 54 apples left.
Step 3: We know that each pie takes 6 apples, so we can divide the number of apples left by 6 to find out how many pies they can make. 
54 ÷ 6 = 9
Therefore, they can make 9 pies with the remaining apples. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

Isabel needed 5 brownies for her party, but she only baked 3. So, she still needs to make 2 more brownies.

If she used 5 cups of flour for each brownie, then she would need 5 x 2 = 10 cups of flour to make the remaining 2 brownies. 

Therefore, Isabel still needs 10 cups of flour to make the total of 5 brownies for her party.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many games Kaleb had left after selling 46 of them. We can do this by subtracting 46 from 76:

76 - 46 = 30

So Kaleb had 30 games left. 

Next, we need to figure out how many boxes he needed to pack them up. We know he put 5 games in each box, so we can divide the total number of games by 5:

30 ÷ 5 = 6

Therefore, Kaleb needed 6 boxes to pack up his remaining games. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find the total weight of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends. We can do this by adding the weight of paper recycled by Gwen and her friends:

5 + 13 = 18 pounds

Next, we need to find out how many points they earned for recycling 18 pounds of paper. We know that for every 3 pounds recycled, they earn 1 point. So, we can divide the total weight of paper recycled by 3 to find out how many points they earned:

18 ÷ 3 = 6 points

Therefore, Gwen and her friends earned 6 points for recycling 18 pounds of paper. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

3 puppies + 3 puppies = 6 puppies 

Now, we need to figure out how many puppies need to be adopted. 

6 puppies - 3 puppies (adopted each day) = 3 puppies 

So, there are 3 puppies left to be adopted. 

If 3 puppies are adopted each day, it will take 1 day to adopt 3 puppies. 

Therefore, it will take 1 day to adopt the remaining 3 puppies. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: At the fair Adam bought 13 tickets. After riding the ferris wheel he had 4 tickets left. If each ticket cost 9 dollars, how much money did Adam spend riding the ferris wheel?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Find out how many tickets Adam used on the ferris wheel.
To do this, we can subtract the number of tickets he had left from the number of tickets he bought:
13 - 4 = 9
So Adam used 9 tickets on the ferris wheel.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the tickets Adam used.
Each ticket costs $9, so we can multiply the number of tickets Adam used by the cost per ticket:
9 x $9 = $81
Therefore, Adam spent $81 riding the ferris wheel.

So the answer is: Adam spent $81 riding the ferris wheel. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $81.

Q: A chef needs to cook 9 potatoes. He has already cooked 7. If each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how many potatoes the chef still needs to cook. We can do this by subtracting the number of potatoes he has already cooked from the total number of potatoes he needs to cook:

9 - 7 = 2

So the chef still needs to cook 2 potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes to cook one potato. We know that each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, so:

1 potato = 3 minutes

Finally, we can use this information to figure out how long it will take to cook the remaining 2 potatoes. We can multiply the time it takes to cook one potato by the number of potatoes left to cook:

2 potatoes x 3 minutes per potato = 6 minutes

So it will take the chef 6 minutes to cook the remaining 2 potatoes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new ones were brought in. 

Total number of puppies = 5 + 35 = 40 

Next, we need to find out how many puppies are left to be adopted. 

Number of puppies left to be adopted = 40 - (number of puppies adopted) 

We know that 8 puppies are adopted each day, so we can set up an equation: 

Number of days = (number of puppies left to be adopted) / (number of puppies adopted per day) 

Number of days = (40 - (number of puppies adopted)) / 8 

We want to find out how long it will take for all the puppies to be adopted, so we can set up another equation: 

Number of puppies adopted = 40

Q: Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 41 seeds and planted 29 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Emily have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many seeds Emily planted in her small gardens. To do this, we can subtract the number of seeds she planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds she started with:

41 - 29 = 12

So Emily planted 12 seeds in her small gardens. We also know that she planted 4 seeds in each small garden. To find out how many small gardens she had, we can divide the total number of seeds she planted in small gardens by the number of seeds she planted in each garden:

12 ÷ 4 = 3

Therefore, Emily had 3 small gardens. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 6 dollars. If Katie bought 5 roses and 5 daisies, how much did she spend?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of flowers that Katie bought. Since she bought 5 roses and 5 daisies, the total number of flowers she bought is 5 + 5 = 10.

Next, we need to find the cost of each flower. According to the problem, each flower costs 6 dollars.

Now, we can find the total cost of all the flowers Katie bought by multiplying the number of flowers by the cost per flower. So, the total cost is:

10 flowers x $6 per flower = $60

Therefore, Katie spent $60 on 5 roses and 5 daisies from April's discount flowers. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $60.

First, we need to find out how many quarters Roger has. We know he has 3 piles of quarters, and each pile has 7 quarters. So, 3 x 7 = 21 quarters.

Next, we need to find out how many dimes Roger has. We know he has 3 piles of dimes, and each pile has 7 dimes. So, 3 x 7 = 21 dimes.

Finally, we can add the number of quarters and dimes together to find the total number of coins Roger has. 21 quarters + 21 dimes = 42 coins.

Therefore, Roger has a total of 42 coins. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 42.

To do this, we can subtract 44 from the total number of pictures Wendy uploaded: 

79 - 44 = 35 

So, Wendy had 35 pictures left to divide among 5 albums. 

To find out how many pictures were in each album, we can divide 35 by 5: 

35 ÷ 5 = 7 

Therefore, Wendy put 44 pictures in one album and 7 pictures in each of the other 5 albums. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 44 pictures in one album and 7 pictures in each of the other 5 albums.

Q: Kaleb had 34 books. If he sold 17 of them and used the money he earned to buy 7 new books, how many books would Kaleb have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the 17 books Kaleb sold from his original 34 books: 

34 - 17 = 17 

Now we know that Kaleb has 17 books left. 

Next, we need to figure out how many books Kaleb can buy with the money he earned from selling the 17 books. We don't know the price of each book, so let's call it "x". 

Kaleb earned: 17 books x price per book 

We don't know the exact amount, but we do know that Kaleb used all the money he earned to buy 7 new books. So: 

17 books x price per book = 7 books x price per book 

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by "price per book": 

17 books = 7 books 

This doesn't make sense, so we made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work. 

Ah, we forgot to divide both sides by "price per book"! Let's try that again: 

17 books x price per book = 7 books x price per book 

17 books = 7 books 

Now we can solve for "price per book": 

17 books / 7 books = 2. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Kaleb would have 12 books.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the adult meals. Each adult meal costs $5, and there are 7 adults in the group, so the total cost of the adult meals would be:

$5 x 7 = $35

Since the kids eat for free, we don't need to factor in any additional costs for them. Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat would be:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria, which is the sum of red and green apples: 

37 + 45 = 82

Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if all the apples were distributed equally: 

82 ÷ 51 = 1.61 (rounded to two decimal places)

Since we can't give a student a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each student would get 1 apple. 

Now, we can find out how many apples were actually needed for the 51 students: 

51 x 1 = 51

Finally, we can subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples ordered to find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with: 

82 - 51 = 31

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 31 extra apples.

9 trays from one table + 7 trays from another table = 16 trays in total. 

Next, we need to figure out how many trips Jerry will need to make. 

Since Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make multiple trips. 

To figure out how many trips he needs to make, we can divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry in one trip: 

16 trays ÷ 8 trays per trip = 2 trips 

Therefore, Jerry will need to make 2 trips to pick up all 16 trays. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Wendy put 27 pictures into one album. So, we subtract 27 from the total number of pictures to find out how many pictures were left to be distributed among the 9 albums.

45 - 27 = 18

Now we need to divide the remaining 18 pictures equally among the 9 albums.

18 ÷ 9 = 2

Therefore, there were 2 pictures in each of the 9 albums. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

Q: At the fair there were 12 people in line for the bumper cars. If 10 of them got tired of waiting and left and 15 more got in line, how many people would be in line?
A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Start with the initial number of people in line, which is 12.

Step 2: Subtract the number of people who left the line, which is 10. This gives us 12 - 10 = 2.

Step 3: Add the number of people who got in line after the others left, which is 15. This gives us 2 + 15 = 17.

Therefore, there would be 17 people in line after 10 people left and 15 more got in line. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 17.

Next, we know that he spent 27 tickets on a beanie. So, we can subtract 27 from 46 to find out how many tickets he has left: 

46 - 27 = 19

So, after buying the beanie, Victor has 19 tickets left.

Finally, we know that he won 39 more tickets. So, we can add 39 to the 19 tickets he already had:

19 + 39 = 58

Therefore, Victor would have 58 tickets after spending 27 on a beanie and winning 39 more tickets. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 58.

Q: A painter needed to paint 10 rooms in a building. Each room takes 8 hours to paint. If he already painted 8 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

The painter needs to paint a total of 10 rooms, and each room takes 8 hours to paint. So, the total time required to paint all 10 rooms would be:

10 rooms x 8 hours per room = 80 hours

Now, the painter has already painted 8 rooms. So, the number of rooms left to paint would be:

10 total rooms - 8 rooms already painted = 2 rooms left to paint

To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the remaining 2 rooms, we need to calculate the time required to paint those 2 rooms. Since each room takes 8 hours to paint, the total time required to paint 2 rooms would be:

2 rooms x 8 hours per room = 16 hours

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 16 hours to paint the remaining 2 rooms. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 16.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new ones were brought in. 

9 + 12 = 21 

So, there are 21 puppies in the shelter now. 

Next, we need to find out how many puppies will be left after a certain number of days. 

If 3 puppies are adopted each day, then after 1 day, there will be 21 - 3 = 18 puppies left. 

After 2 days, there will be 18 - 3 = 15 puppies left. 

We can continue this pattern until we reach 0 puppies left. 

So, the number of days it will take to adopt all the puppies can be found by dividing the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted each day and rounding up to the nearest whole number. 

21 / 3 = 7 

Therefore, it will take 7 days to adopt all the puppies.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we know that Paige scored 11 points. 

Next, we need to figure out how many points were scored by the other players. We know that everyone else scored 6 points each, so we can represent that as:

6x, where x is the number of other players on the team.

So the total number of points scored by everyone else is:

6x * x = 6x^2

Now we can set up an equation to represent the total number of points scored:

11 + 6x^2 = 41

Simplifying this equation, we get:

6x^2 = 30

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

x^2 = 5

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

x = ±√5

Since we can't have a negative number of players, we can ignore the negative solution and conclude that there were:

x = √5 ≈ 2.24

So there were approximately 2.24 other players on Paige's team. However, since we can't have a fraction of a player, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there were:

x = 3 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is There were 4 players on Paige's team.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Find out how much money Frank has left after buying new mower blades.
To do this, we need to subtract the cost of the blades from the amount of money Frank made:
19 - 11 = 8

So Frank has 8 dollars left.

Step 2: Find out how many 2 dollar games Frank can buy with 8 dollars.
To do this, we need to divide the amount of money Frank has left by the cost of each game:
8 ÷ 2 = 4

So Frank can buy 4 2-dollar games with the money he has left.

Therefore, the answer to the problem is: Frank can buy 4 2-dollar games with the money he has left.

Henry earned 5 dollars for each lawn he mowed. So, if he mowed all 12 lawns, he would have earned:

5 dollars/lawn x 12 lawns = 60 dollars

However, he forgot to mow 7 of them. So, he only mowed:

12 lawns - 7 lawns = 5 lawns

8 friends - 3 players who quit = 5 players left 

Next, we need to find out how many lives each of the 5 players had. 

Each player left had 3 lives 

Finally, we can find the total number of lives the players had by multiplying the number of players left by the number of lives each player had. 

5 players left x 3 lives each = 15 total lives 

Therefore, the players had a total of 15 lives.

Will originally had 7 boxes - 3 boxes given to his little brother = 4 boxes left. 

Next, we need to find out how many pieces of chocolate candy are in each box. 

We know that each box has 4 pieces inside it. 

Finally, we can multiply the number of boxes left by the number of pieces in each box to find out how many pieces of chocolate candy Will still has. 

4 boxes left x 4 pieces per box = 16 pieces of chocolate candy. 

Therefore, Will still has 16 pieces of chocolate candy after giving 3 boxes to his little brother.

Q: A new building needed 14 windows. The builder had already installed 8 of them. If it takes 8 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

The builder needs to install 14 windows in total, out of which 8 have already been installed. So, the number of windows left to be installed is:

14 - 8 = 6

Now, we know that it takes 8 hours to install each window. So, to install 6 windows, the builder will take:

6 x 8 = 48 hours

Therefore, it will take the builder 48 hours to install the remaining 6 windows. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 48.

Q: A company invited 24 people to a luncheon, but 10 of them didn't show up. If the tables they had held 7 people each, how many tables do they need?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many people actually showed up to the luncheon. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of people who didn't show up from the total number of people invited: 

24 - 10 = 14 

So, 14 people showed up to the luncheon. 

Next, we need to figure out how many tables are needed to seat these 14 people. 

Since each table can hold 7 people, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people per table: 

14 ÷ 7 = 2 

Therefore, they need 2 tables to seat the 14 people who showed up to the luncheon. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Luke has 3 new cards and 9 old cards, so he has a total of 12 cards to put in the binder.

Each page of the binder can hold 3 cards.

To find out how many pages Luke will need, we can divide the total number of cards by the number of cards per page:

12 cards ÷ 3 cards per page = 4 pages

Therefore, Luke will need 4 pages to organize all of his cards in the binder. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

Q: Will made 104 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 41 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 9 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Will has left after buying the new mower blades. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the blades from the amount of money he made:

104 dollars - 41 dollars = 63 dollars

Now we know that Will has 63 dollars left to spend on games. To find out how many 9 dollar games he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game:

63 dollars ÷ 9 dollars/game = 7 games

Therefore, Will can buy 7 games with the money he has left after buying the new mower blades. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

On Monday, Dave worked for 6 hours, so he earned 6 dollars per hour for 6 hours, which is:

6 dollars/hour x 6 hours = 36 dollars

On Tuesday, Dave worked for 2 hours, so he earned 6 dollars per hour for 2 hours, which is:

6 dollars/hour x 2 hours = 12 dollars

To find out how much money Dave made in those two days, we just need to add the amounts he earned on Monday and Tuesday:

36 dollars + 12 dollars = 48 dollars

Therefore, Dave made 48 dollars in those two days. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 48.

First, we need to figure out how many adults are in the group. We know that there are 9 people in total and 2 of them are kids, so that means there are 9 - 2 = 7 adults.

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the adults' meals. Each adult meal costs $2, so for 7 adults, the total cost would be 7 x $2 = $14.

Since the kids eat for free, we don't need to factor in any additional costs for them.

Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat would be $14.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many trips Luke will make to pick up the 20 trays from one table. Since he can only carry 4 trays at a time, we can divide 20 by 4 to get:

20 / 4 = 5

So Luke will need to make 5 trips to pick up all 20 trays from one table.

Next, we need to find out how many trips he will make to pick up the 16 trays from the other table. Using the same method as before, we can divide 16 by 4 to get:

16 / 4 = 4

So Luke will need to make 4 trips to pick up all 16 trays from the other table.

Finally, we can add up the number of trips he will make for each table to get the total number of trips:

5 + 4 = 9

Therefore, Luke will make a total of 9 trips to pick up all the trays from both tables.

So, Tom has 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left for rides.

Step 4: Each ride cost 4 tickets.
Step 5: We need to find out how many rides he could go on.
To find out how many rides Tom can go on, we need to divide the number of tickets he has left by the number of tickets required for each ride.

Q: A trivia team had 5 members total, but during a game 2 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 6 points, how many points were scored total?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we know that the trivia team had 5 members total. But 2 members didn't show up, so that leaves us with 5 - 2 = 3 members who did show up.

Next, we know that each member who showed up scored 6 points. So we can multiply the number of members who showed up (3) by the number of points each member scored (6) to get the total number of points:

3 x 6 = 18

Therefore, the total number of points scored by the members who showed up is 18. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 18.

Q: A toy store had 6 giant stuffed bears in stock when they got another shipment with 18 bears in it. The put the bears onto shelves with 6 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of bears the store has after receiving the new shipment. We can do this by adding the number of bears in stock to the number of bears in the new shipment: 

6 + 18 = 24 

So the store now has 24 giant stuffed bears. 

Next, we need to figure out how many shelves they used to display the bears. We can do this by dividing the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf: 

24 ÷ 6 = 4 

Therefore, the store used 4 shelves to display the giant stuffed bears. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if only 10 students wanted fruit. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 ÷ 10 = 4.2 apples per student.

Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples.

So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples.

Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

First, we need to find the total number of candies they had before eating any. To do that, we can add Katie's and her sister's candies:

Total candies = Katie's candies + Sister's candies
Total candies = 8 + 23
Total candies = 31

Now, we know they ate 8 candies on the first night. So, we need to subtract that from the total candies to find out how many they have left:

Candies left = Total candies - Candies eaten
Candies left = 31 - 8
Candies left = 23

Therefore, they have 23 candies left after eating 8 on the first night. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 23.

27 ÷ 9 = 3 

So the store used 3 shelves to display the bears. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: A pet shelter had 17 puppies when another 55 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new ones were brought in. 

Total number of puppies = 17 + 55 = 72

Next, we need to find the number of puppies that still need to be adopted. 

Number of puppies to be adopted = 72 - (8 x number of days)

We can set this expression equal to zero to find the number of days it will take for all the puppies to be adopted. 

72 - (8 x number of days) = 0

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

8 x number of days = 72

Dividing both sides by 8, we get: 

Number of days = 9

Therefore, it will take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted if 8 puppies are adopted each day. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

Q: A waiter at 'The Greasy Spoon' restaurant had 29 customers to wait on. During the lunch rush he added another 20 customers. If 34 of the customers didn't leave him a tip, how many customers did leave a tip?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find the total number of customers the waiter had to serve. We know he had 29 customers to start with, and then he added another 20 during the lunch rush. So the total number of customers he served is:

29 + 20 = 49

Next, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers. We know that 34 customers didn't leave a tip, so the number of customers who did leave a tip is:

49 - 34 = 15

Therefore, 15 customers left a tip. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 15.

13 - 4 = 9

So Rachel sold 9 chocolate bars.

Next, we need to find out how much money Rachel made from selling those 9 bars. Each bar costs $2, so we can multiply the number of bars sold by the price per bar:

9 x $2 = $18

Therefore, Rachel would have made $18 from selling the chocolate bars.

Tom bought 12 boxes of chocolate candy. Each box has 6 pieces inside it, so Tom had a total of 12 x 6 = 72 pieces of chocolate candy.

Tom gave 7 boxes to his little brother. Each box has 6 pieces inside it, so Tom gave away a total of 7 x 6 = 42 pieces of chocolate candy.

To find out how many pieces Tom still had, we need to subtract the number of pieces he gave away from the total number of pieces he had. 

So, Tom still had 72 - 42 = 30 pieces of chocolate candy.

Q: The school cafeteria ordered 42 red apples and 7 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 9 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria, which is 42 + 7 = 49 apples.

Next, we need to find out how many apples each student will get if only 9 students want fruit. To do this, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 49 ÷ 9 = 5.44 (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

Since we can't give a fraction of an apple to a student, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each student will get 5 apples.

Now we can find out how many apples were actually needed for the 9 students: 5 apples per student x 9 students = 45 apples.

Finally, we can subtract the number of apples needed from the total number of apples ordered to find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with: 49 apples - 45 apples = 4 extra apples.

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 4 extra apples. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Find the total number of problems on one worksheet.
There are 7 problems on one worksheet.

Step 2: Find the total number of problems on all the worksheets.
To find the total number of problems on all the worksheets, we need to multiply the number of problems on one worksheet by the total number of worksheets. So, 7 x 17 = 119.

Step 3: Find the number of problems the teacher has already graded.
The teacher has already graded 8 worksheets, so the number of problems she has already graded is 8 x 7 = 56.

Step 4: Find the number of problems the teacher still needs to grade.
To find the number of problems the teacher still needs to grade, we need to subtract the number of problems she has already graded from the total number of problems. So, 119 - 56 = 63.

Next, we need to find out how many worksheets the teacher still needs to grade. We know she has already graded 7 out of 15 worksheets, so:

15 total worksheets - 7 graded worksheets = 8 worksheets left to grade

Finally, we can multiply the number of problems per worksheet by the number of worksheets left to grade to find the total number of problems the teacher still needs to grade:

3 problems/worksheet x 8 worksheets = 24 problems

Therefore, the teacher still needs to grade 24 more problems.

To find the total number of candies, we need to add the number of candies Debby had and the number of candies her sister had.

Total candies = 32 + 42 = 74

Step 2: Subtract the number of candies they ate on the first night.

We know that they ate 35 candies on the first night, so we need to subtract that from the total number of candies they had.

Candies left = Total candies - Candies eaten on the first night
Candies left = 74 - 35
Candies left = 39

Therefore, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left after eating 35 pieces on the first night.

Q: Vanessa had 16 music files and 48 video files on her flash drive. If she deleted 30 of the files, how many files were still on her flash drive?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of files Vanessa had on her flash drive:

Total number of files = 16 music files + 48 video files
Total number of files = 64 files

Next, we need to subtract the number of files Vanessa deleted:

Number of files after deletion = Total number of files - Number of files deleted
Number of files after deletion = 64 files - 30 files
Number of files after deletion = 34 files

Therefore, Vanessa had 34 files left on her flash drive after deleting 30 files. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 34.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

The painter needs to paint a total of 6 rooms, and each room takes 5 hours to paint. So, the total time the painter needs to complete all 6 rooms is:

6 rooms x 5 hours per room = 30 hours

Now, the painter has already painted 2 rooms. So, the remaining number of rooms to be painted is:

6 total rooms - 2 rooms already painted = 4 rooms remaining

To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms, we need to calculate the time it will take to paint the remaining 4 rooms. This can be done by multiplying the time it takes to paint one room (5 hours) by the number of remaining rooms (4):

5 hours per room x 4 remaining rooms = 20 hours

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 20 hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

Q: April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 3 dollars. If Emily bought 2 roses and 2 daisies, how much did she spend?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of flowers Emily bought. She bought 2 roses and 2 daisies, so the total number of flowers is 2 + 2 = 4.

Next, we need to find the cost of each flower. The sale price is $3 per flower.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of flowers by the cost per flower. So, 4 flowers at $3 each is 4 x $3 = $12.

Therefore, Emily spent $12 on 2 roses and 2 daisies from April's discount flowers. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $12.

Q: Maria bought 2 new chairs and 2 new tables for her house. If she spent 8 minutes on each piece furniture putting it together, how many minutes did it take her to finish?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces of furniture Maria bought in total. We know she bought 2 chairs and 2 tables, so the total number of pieces of furniture is 2 + 2 = 4.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Maria to put together one piece of furniture. We know she spent 8 minutes on each piece, so it takes her 8 minutes to put together one chair or one table.

Finally, we can calculate how long it took Maria to put together all four pieces of furniture. Since it takes her 8 minutes to put together one piece, it will take her 8 x 4 = 32 minutes to put together all four pieces of furniture.

Therefore, Maria took 32 minutes to finish putting together all the furniture.

Q: Faye was playing a video game where she scores 7 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 2 treasures on the first level and 6 on the second, what would her score be?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

Faye found 2 treasures on the first level, so her score for the first level would be:

2 treasures x 7 points per treasure = 14 points

Next, Faye found 6 treasures on the second level, so her score for the second level would be:

6 treasures x 7 points per treasure = 42 points

To find Faye's total score, we just need to add her scores from each level:

Total score = 14 points + 42 points = 56 points

Therefore, Faye's score would be 56 points. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 56.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of customers the waiter had to serve. We can do this by adding the initial 26 customers to the additional 27 customers he served during the lunch rush:

26 + 27 = 53

So the waiter had to serve 53 customers in total.

Next, we need to subtract the 27 customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers:

53 - 27 = 26

So 26 customers left a tip.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many books are on each shelf. We know that each shelf has exactly 4 books on it, so we can multiply 4 by the number of shelves for each type of book:

5 shelves of mystery books x 4 books per shelf = 20 mystery books
3 shelves of picture books x 4 books per shelf = 12 picture books

Now we know how many books are on each type of shelf, but we need to find the total number of books. We can add the number of mystery books and picture books together:

20 mystery books + 12 picture books = 32 total books

So Gwen has a total of 32 books on her bookcase. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 32.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many players were left after 8 players quit. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of players who quit from the original number of players: 

13 - 8 = 5 

So, there were 5 players left. 

Next, we need to find out how many lives each of the 8 players who quit had. 

We know that each player had 6 lives, so we can multiply the number of players who quit by the number of lives each player had: 

8 x 6 = 48 

So, the 8 players who quit had a total of 48 lives. 

Finally, we can add the total number of lives the 8 players who quit had to the total number of lives the 5 remaining players had: 

48 + (5 x 6) = 78 

Therefore, the total number of lives the players had was 78.

First, we know that Bianca scored 45 points. 

Next, we need to figure out how many points were scored by the other players. We know that everyone else scored 6 points each, so we can use that information to set up an equation:

6x = total points - 45

Here, x represents the number of players on the team (not including Bianca). 

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

6x = 75 - 45

6x = 30

Now we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 6:

x = 5

So there were 5 other players on Bianca's team. Adding Bianca herself, the total number of players on the team is 6. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6 players.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Paige picked 53 flowers for the wedding.

Next, we know that she was making bouquets with 7 flowers in each one. To figure out how many bouquets she could make, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet:

53 flowers ÷ 7 flowers/bouquet = 7.57 bouquets

Since we can't have a fraction of a bouquet, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means that Paige can make 7 bouquets.

Finally, we know that 18 of the flowers wilted before the wedding. To figure out how many bouquets she can still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers:

53 flowers - 18 wilted flowers = 35 flowers

Now we can repeat the earlier calculation to figure out how many bouquets she can make with the remaining flowers:

35 flowers ÷ 7 flowers/bouquet = 5 bouquets

Therefore, Paige can still make 5 bouquets with the remaining flowers.

Q: There are 65 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 17 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 8 groups, how many students would be in each group?
A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: We know that there are 65 students trying out for the trivia teams.
Step 2: We also know that 17 of them didn't get picked for the team, so the number of students who did get picked is 65 - 17 = 48.
Step 3: We need to divide the 48 students into 8 groups. To do this, we can use division: 48 ÷ 8 = 6.
Step 4: Therefore, there would be 6 students in each group. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

Q: The cafeteria had 62 apples. For lunch they handed out 8 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 9 apples, how many pies could they make?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Find out how many apples were left after handing out 8 to students.
To do this, we can subtract 8 from the total number of apples:
62 - 8 = 54

Step 2: Find out how many pies can be made with 54 apples.
To do this, we can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples needed for each pie:
54 ÷ 9 = 6

Therefore, the cafeteria can make 6 pies with the remaining 54 apples. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

Q: Nancy and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Nancy picked 38 and her mother picked 47. If only 71 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we need to find the total number of carrots they picked. We can do this by adding Nancy's and her mother's carrots:

38 + 47 = 85

So, they picked a total of 85 carrots.

Next, we know that only 71 of these carrots were good. So, we can subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots to find the number of bad carrots:

85 - 71 = 14

Therefore, they had 14 bad carrots. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

Q: Rachel was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 9 books on it. If she had 6 shelves of mystery books and 2 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many books Rachel has on each shelf. She has 9 books on each shelf.

Next, we need to find out how many shelves of mystery books she has. She has 6 shelves of mystery books.

So, the total number of mystery books she has is 6 shelves x 9 books per shelf = 54 mystery books.

Similarly, we need to find out how many shelves of picture books she has. She has 2 shelves of picture books.

So, the total number of picture books she has is 2 shelves x 9 books per shelf = 18 picture books.

Finally, we can add the total number of mystery books and picture books to find the total number of books Rachel has. 

Total number of books = 54 mystery books + 18 picture books = 72 books.

Therefore, Rachel has a total of 72 books. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 72.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Nancy uploaded a total of 41 pictures. 

Next, we know that she put 37 pictures into one album. 

To find out how many pictures were in each of the other two albums, we can subtract 37 from 41 to get the number of pictures that were not in the first album: 

41 - 37 = 4 

So there were 4 pictures left to be divided between the other two albums. 

Since we want to know how many pictures were in each of the other two albums, we can divide the remaining 4 pictures by 2 (since there are two albums left): 

4 ÷ 2 = 2 

Therefore, Nancy put 2 pictures in each of the other two albums. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 37 pictures in one album, and 2 pictures in each of the other two albums.

At the start of the year, there were 40 students. 

During the year, 14 students left. So, the number of students decreased by 14. 

Therefore, the number of students remaining after the 14 students left is: 

40 - 14 = 26 

Now, 26 new students came to school. 

So, the total number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year is: 

26 (students who remained) + 26 (new students) = 52 

Therefore, there were 52 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

Q: A pet shelter had 8 puppies when another 19 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new ones were brought in. 

Total number of puppies = 8 + 19 = 27 

Next, we need to find out how many puppies are left after each day of adoptions. 

Number of puppies left after 1 day = 27 - 3 = 24 
Number of puppies left after 2 days = 24 - 3 = 21 
Number of puppies left after 3 days = 21 - 3 = 18 

We can see that 3 puppies are adopted each day, so we can divide the total number of puppies by 3 to find out how many days it will take to adopt all of them. 

Number of days = 27 / 3 = 9 

Therefore, it will take 9 days to adopt all of the puppies. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

First, we know that Katie scored 4 points. 

Then, we know that everyone else scored 4 points each. 

Let's use "x" to represent the number of players on Katie's team (not including Katie herself). 

So, the total number of points scored by everyone else would be 4x. 

Adding Katie's 4 points, we get:

4 + 4x = 12 

Now we can solve for x:

4x = 8 

x = 2 

Therefore, there were 2 players on Katie's team (not including Katie herself). 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how many trips Henry will make to pick up the 29 trays from one table. To do this, we can divide 29 by 9:

29 ÷ 9 = 3 with a remainder of 2

This means that Henry can carry 9 trays three times, but he will have 2 trays left over that he will need to make an additional trip for. So, he will make a total of 4 trips to pick up the 29 trays.

Next, we need to find out how many trips Henry will make to pick up the 52 trays from the other table. To do this, we can divide 52 by 9:

52 ÷ 9 = 5 with a remainder of 7

This means that Henry can carry 9 trays five times, but he will have 7 trays left over that he will need to make an additional trip for. So, he will make a total of 6 trips to pick up the 52 trays.

Therefore, in total, Henry will make 4 + 6 = 10 trips to pick up all the trays.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of working video games Dave has.
To find the number of working video games, we need to subtract the number of non-working games from the total number of games.
Working games = Total games - Non-working games
Working games = 10 - 2
Working games = 8

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Dave can earn.
Since Dave can sell each working game for $4, we can multiply the number of working games by $4 to find the total amount of money he can earn.
Total money = Number of working games x Price per game
Total money = 8 x $4
Total money = $32

Therefore, Dave can earn $32 by selling his working video games.

First, we need to figure out how many adults are in the group. We know that there are 13 people in total and 9 of them are kids, so we can subtract 9 from 13 to get:

13 - 9 = 4

So there are 4 adults in the group.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the adult meals. Each adult meal costs $7, so we can multiply the number of adults by the cost per meal:

4 x $7 = $28

So the cost of the adult meals is $28.

Finally, we need to add up the total cost for the group. Since the kids eat for free, we only need to consider the cost of the adult meals:

Total cost = cost of adult meals = $28

Therefore, it would cost $28 for the group to eat.

At the start of the year, there were 31 students. 

Then, 5 students left. So, the number of students decreased by 5. 

Therefore, the number of students remaining after 5 left is: 

31 - 5 = 26 

Finally, 11 new students came to school. So, the number of students increased by 11. 

Therefore, the total number of students at the end of the year is: 

26 + 11 = 37 

So, there were 37 students in fourth grade at the end of the year. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 37.

Q: Will had 57 dollars. If he spent 27 bucks on a new game, how many 6 dollar toys could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Will has left after buying the new game. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the game from his initial amount of money:

$57 - $27 = $30

Now we know that Will has $30 left to spend on toys. We also know that each toy costs $6. To find out how many toys he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each toy:

$30 ÷ $6 = 5

Therefore, Will can buy 5 six-dollar toys with the money he has left after buying the new game. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

Q: Amy was playing a video game where she scores 4 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 6 treasures on the first level and 2 on the second, what would her score be?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many points Amy scored on the first level. We know that she found 6 treasures and each treasure is worth 4 points, so we can multiply 6 by 4:

6 x 4 = 24

So Amy scored 24 points on the first level.

Next, we need to find out how many points she scored on the second level. We know that she found 2 treasures and each treasure is worth 4 points, so we can multiply 2 by 4:

2 x 4 = 8

So Amy scored 8 points on the second level.

Finally, we can add up the points she scored on both levels to find her total score:

24 + 8 = 32

Therefore, Amy's score would be 32 points. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 32.

Q: Haley uploaded 65 pictures to Facebook. She put 17 pics into one album and put the rest into 6 different albums. How many pictures were in each album?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pictures Haley put into the 17-pic album. We can do this by subtracting the number of pictures in the other 6 albums from the total number of pictures:

65 - (6 x ?) = 17

To solve for the number of pictures in each of the 6 albums, we need to isolate the variable (?). We can do this by first multiplying 6 to the unknown variable:

65 - 6x = 17

Then, we can simplify the equation by subtracting 65 from both sides:

-6x = -48

Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by -6:

x = 8

Therefore, Haley put 17 pictures in one album and 8 pictures in each of the other 6 albums. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 17 pictures in one album and 8 pictures in each of the other 6 albums.

Q: The school cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 21 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria, which is the sum of red and green apples: 

33 + 23 = 56 

Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if all the fruit was distributed equally: 

56 apples ÷ 21 students = 2.67 apples per student 

Since we can't give a student a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each student would get 2 apples. 

To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria has, we need to subtract the number of apples given to the students from the total number of apples ordered: 

56 apples - (2 apples x 21 students) = 56 apples - 42 apples = 14 extra apples 

So the cafeteria ended up with 14 extra apples.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many coloring books the store had left after getting rid of 37. We can do this by subtracting 37 from 86:

86 - 37 = 49

So the store had 49 coloring books left. 

Next, we need to figure out how many shelves they used to display the remaining coloring books. We can do this by dividing the number of coloring books by the number of books on each shelf:

49 ÷ 7 = 7

So the store used 7 shelves to display the remaining coloring books. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

Q: Chloe was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 6 books on it. If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many books Chloe has on each shelf. We know that each shelf has exactly 6 books on it.

Next, we need to find out how many shelves of mystery books Chloe has. We know that she has 5 shelves of mystery books.

To find out how many mystery books Chloe has in total, we can multiply the number of shelves by the number of books on each shelf: 

5 shelves x 6 books per shelf = 30 mystery books

We can use the same method to find out how many picture books Chloe has in total. We know that she has 4 shelves of picture books, so:

4 shelves x 6 books per shelf = 24 picture books

To find out how many books Chloe has in total, we can add the number of mystery books and picture books together:

30 mystery books + 24 picture books = 54 books in total

Therefore, Chloe has a total of 54 books. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 54.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many points Tiffany scored on the first level. We know she found 3 treasures and each treasure is worth 6 points, so:

3 treasures x 6 points per treasure = 18 points on the first level

Next, we need to find out how many points she scored on the second level. We know she found 5 treasures and each treasure is worth 6 points, so:

5 treasures x 6 points per treasure = 30 points on the second level

Finally, we can add up the points from both levels to find Tiffany's total score:

18 points on the first level + 30 points on the second level = 48 points total

Therefore, Tiffany's score would be 48 points. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 48.

Q: Wendy picked 45 flowers for her friend’s wedding. She was making bouquets with 5 flowers in each one. If 35 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we know that Wendy picked 45 flowers for the wedding.

Next, we know that she was making bouquets with 5 flowers in each one. To find out how many bouquets she could make, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet:

45 flowers ÷ 5 flowers/bouquet = 9 bouquets

So Wendy could make 9 bouquets with the 45 flowers she picked.

However, we also know that 35 of the flowers wilted before the wedding. To find out how many bouquets she could still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers:

45 flowers - 35 wilted flowers = 10 flowers remaining

Now we can divide the remaining flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet:

10 flowers ÷ 5 flowers/bouquet = 2 bouquets

So Wendy could still make 2 bouquets with the remaining flowers. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2 bouquets.

The painter needs to paint 12 rooms in total, and each room takes 3 hours to paint. So, the total time the painter needs to paint all the rooms is:

12 rooms x 3 hours per room = 36 hours

Now, the painter has already painted 4 rooms. So, the remaining number of rooms to be painted is:

12 total rooms - 4 rooms already painted = 8 rooms remaining

To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms, we need to calculate the time it will take to paint those 8 rooms. 

8 rooms x 3 hours per room = 24 hours

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 24 hours to paint the remaining 8 rooms.

Next, we need to figure out how many shelves the store used to display the bears. We can do this by dividing the total number of bears by the number of bears on each shelf: 

12 ÷ 6 = 2 

So the store used 2 shelves to display the bears. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

Q: A painter needed to paint 12 rooms in a building. Each room takes 7 hours to paint. If he already painted 5 rooms, how much longer will he take to paint the rest?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

The painter needs to paint a total of 12 rooms, and each room takes 7 hours to paint. So, the total time the painter will take to paint all 12 rooms is:

12 rooms x 7 hours per room = 84 hours

Now, the painter has already painted 5 rooms. So, the number of rooms left to paint is:

12 total rooms - 5 rooms already painted = 7 rooms left to paint

To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms, we need to calculate the time it will take to paint those 7 rooms. Since each room takes 7 hours to paint, the total time to paint the remaining 7 rooms is:

7 rooms x 7 hours per room = 49 hours

Therefore, the painter will take an additional 49 hours to paint the remaining 7 rooms. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 49 hours.

First, we need to find out how many enemies were defeated. To do this, we can subtract the number of enemies left from the total number of enemies:

11 - 8 = 3

So, 3 enemies were defeated.

Next, we need to find out how many points were earned for defeating these enemies. We know that each enemy defeated gives 7 points, so we can multiply the number of enemies defeated by 7:

3 x 7 = 21

Therefore, the player would earn 21 points for defeating 3 enemies.

24 ÷ 3 = 8

Bianca recycled 8 sets of 3 pounds, which means she earned 8 points.

Next, we need to find out how many points Bianca's friends earned for recycling 3 pounds of paper. We know that for every 3 pounds, they earned one point. So, we can divide 3 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds there are:

3 ÷ 3 = 1

Bianca's friends recycled 1 set of 3 pounds, which means they earned 1 point.

Finally, we can add up the points Bianca and her friends earned:

51 - (8 x ?) = 11

To solve for the missing number, we can rearrange the equation:

8 x ? = 51 - 11

8 x ? = 40

? = 40/8

? = 5

So Nancy put 5 pictures in each of the 8 albums, and 11 pictures in the other album.

8 + 43 = 51

Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if all the apples were distributed equally: 

51 ÷ 42 = 1.21 (rounded to two decimal places)

Since we can't give a student a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means each student would get 1 apple.

Next, we need to find out how many piles of 9 she can make with 72 pieces of candy. We can do this by dividing 72 by 9:

72 ÷ 9 = 8

So Sarah can make 8 piles of candy with 9 pieces in each pile. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

Q: Ned was trying to expand his game collection. He bought 50 games from a friend and bought 27 more at a garage sale. If 74 of the games didn't work, how many good games did he end up with?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of games Ned had before any of them were found to be not working. To do this, we can add the number of games he bought from his friend (50) and the number of games he bought at the garage sale (27):

Total number of games before any were found to be not working = 50 + 27 = 77

Next, we need to subtract the number of games that didn't work (74) from the total number of games to find the number of good games:

Number of good games = Total number of games - Number of games that didn't work
Number of good games = 77 - 74
Number of good games = 3

Therefore, Ned ended up with 3 good games. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

First, we need to find the total number of pictures Rachel has to color. We can do this by adding the number of pictures in each coloring book:

24 + 39 = 63

So Rachel has a total of 63 pictures to color.

Next, we need to subtract the number of pictures she has already colored:

63 - 4 = 59

Therefore, Rachel still has 59 pictures to color.

Total number of students = 28 boys + 4 girls = 32 students 

Next, we need to find out how many groups of 4 students can be made from the total number of students. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students in each group:

Q: Adam had 48 books. If he sold 19 of them and used the money he earned to buy 38 new books, how many books would Adam have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the 19 books that Adam sold from his original 48 books: 

48 - 19 = 29 

So Adam has 29 books left after selling 19. 

Next, we need to figure out how many books Adam can buy with the money he earned from selling the 19 books. We don't know the price of each book, so let's assume that Adam sold each book for $1. 

Adam earned: 

19 books x $1/book = $19 

Now, Adam can use the $19 to buy new books. If each new book costs $1, then he can buy: 

$19 / $1/book = 19 books 

So Adam can buy 19 new books with the money he earned from selling his old books. 

Finally, we can add the 29 books Adam has left to the 19 new books he bought: 

29 + 19 = 48 

So Adam ends up with the same number of books he started with, 48 books. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 48.

Q: Megan had 40 homework problems. She finished 26 of them but still had 2 pages of problems to do. If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Find out how many problems Megan has left to do.
To do this, we subtract the number of problems Megan has finished from the total number of problems she had to do.
Total number of problems = 40
Number of problems finished = 26
Number of problems left = Total number of problems - Number of problems finished
Number of problems left = 40 - 26
Number of problems left = 14

Step 2: Find out how many pages of problems Megan has left to do.
We know that Megan has 2 pages of problems left to do. So, we can divide the number of problems left by 2 to find out how many problems are on each page.
Number of problems on each page = Number of problems left / Number of pages left
Number of problems on each page = 14 / 2
Number of problems on each page = 7

Therefore, there are 7 problems on each page. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

36 + 37 = 73 

So Lana picked 73 flowers in total. 

Next, we need to find out how many flowers she didn't use: 

73 - 70 = 3

First, we need to find the total number of people going on the field trip. We can do this by adding the number of students and adults:

40 students + 14 adults = 54 people

Next, we need to figure out how many vans are needed to transport 54 people. We know that each van can hold 9 people, so we can divide the total number of people by 9:

54 people ÷ 9 people/van = 6 vans

Therefore, Debby's class will need 6 vans to transport everyone to the zoo.

First, we need to figure out how many adults are in the group. We know that there are 12 people in total and 7 of them are kids, so the number of adults would be:

12 - 7 = 5

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the adults' meals. Each adult meal costs $3, and there are 5 adults in the group, so the total cost for the adults' meals would be:

$3 x 5 = $15

Since the kids eat for free, we don't need to calculate any cost for them.

Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat would be $15. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $15.

The waiter had 10 customers in total. Out of those 10, 5 didn't leave a tip. So, the number of customers who did leave a tip is:

10 - 5 = 5

Now, we know that the waiter got $3 from each of the customers who left a tip. So, the total amount of money he earned from those 5 customers is:

Q: A pet shelter had 2 puppies when another 34 were brought in. If 4 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new ones were brought in. 

Total number of puppies = 2 + 34 = 36 

Next, we need to find out how many puppies are left to be adopted. 

Number of puppies left to be adopted = 36 - (4 x number of days) 

We can set this expression equal to zero to find the number of days it takes for all the puppies to be adopted. 

36 - (4 x number of days) = 0 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

4 x number of days = 36 

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: 

Number of days = 9 

Therefore, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted if 4 puppies are adopted each day. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

First, we need to figure out how many trays Jerry needs to pick up in total. 

9 trays from one table + 7 trays from another table = 16 trays in total. 

Next, we need to figure out how many trips Jerry will need to make. 

Since Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make multiple trips. 

To figure out how many trips he needs to make, we can divide the total number of trays by the number of trays he can carry per trip: 

16 trays ÷ 8 trays per trip = 2 trips

Q: Rachel was unboxing some of her old winter clothes. She found 7 boxes of clothing and inside each box there were 3 scarves and 4 mittens. How many pieces of winter clothing did Rachel have total?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how many scarves and mittens are in one box. We know that there are 3 scarves and 4 mittens in each box, so we can add those together to get the total number of items in one box:

3 + 4 = 7

So there are 7 items in each box.

Next, we need to find out how many items Rachel has in total. To do that, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of items in each box:

7 boxes x 7 items per box = 49 items

So Rachel has a total of 49 pieces of winter clothing. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 49.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Isabel picked 66 flowers for the wedding.

Next, we know that she was making bouquets with 8 flowers in each one.

To figure out how many bouquets she could make, we need to divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet:

66 flowers ÷ 8 flowers per bouquet = 8.25 bouquets

However, we can't have a fraction of a bouquet, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means Isabel can make 8 bouquets.

Finally, we know that 10 of the flowers wilted before the wedding. This means Isabel can only use 66 - 10 = 56 flowers.

To figure out how many bouquets she can make with 56 flowers, we repeat the same calculation:

56 flowers ÷ 8 flowers per bouquet = 7 bouquets

So, Isabel can make 7 bouquets with the remaining flowers. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7 bouquets.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of working video games.
To find the number of working video games, we need to subtract the number of non-working games from the total number of games.
Number of working games = Total number of games - Number of non-working games
Number of working games = 15 - 9
Number of working games = 6

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Mike could earn.
To calculate the total amount of money Mike could earn, we need to multiply the number of working games by the price of each game.
Total amount of money = Number of working games x Price per game
Total amount of money = 6 x $5
Total amount of money = $30

Therefore, Mike could earn $30 by selling the working video games.

- Total number of people = 22 + 2 = 24

Step 2: Determine how many people can fit in each van.
- Each van can hold 8 people.

Step 3: Divide the total number of people by the number of people that can fit in each van to find the number of vans needed.
- Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Number of people that can fit in each van
- Number of vans needed = 24 / 8
- Number of vans needed = 3

Therefore, Robin's class will need 3 vans for the field trip to the zoo. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: Mike made 69 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 24 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 5 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Mike has left after buying the new mower blades. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the blades from the amount of money he made:

69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars

Now we know that Mike has 45 dollars left to spend on games. To find out how many 5 dollar games he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game:

45 dollars ÷ 5 dollars/game = 9 games

Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left after buying the new mower blades. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of apples the cafeteria ordered, which is the sum of red and green apples: 

43 + 32 = 75

Next, we need to find out how many apples were actually eaten by the 2 students who wanted fruit. Let's assume each student ate one red and one green apple: 

2 students x 2 apples per student = 4 apples eaten

Finally, we can subtract the number of apples eaten from the total number of apples ordered to find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with: 

75 - 4 = 71 extra apples

Q: Haley and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Haley picked 39 and her mother picked 38. If only 64 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we need to find the total number of carrots they picked. We can do this by adding the number of carrots Haley picked and the number of carrots her mother picked:

39 + 38 = 77

So, they picked a total of 77 carrots.

Next, we need to find the number of bad carrots. We know that only 64 of the carrots were good, so we can subtract this from the total number of carrots to find the number of bad carrots:

77 - 64 = 13

Therefore, they had 13 bad carrots. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 13.

Q: Wendy earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 11 bags, but didn't recycle 2 of them, how many points would she have earned?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how many bags Wendy actually recycled. We know she had 11 bags, but didn't recycle 2 of them. So, the number of bags she recycled would be:

11 - 2 = 9 bags

Next, we need to find out how many points she earned per bag. We know she earned 5 points for each bag, so:

5 points/bag

Finally, we can multiply the number of bags she recycled by the number of points she earned per bag to find out how many points she earned in total. So:

9 bags x 5 points/bag = 45 points

Therefore, Wendy would have earned 45 points if she recycled 9 bags.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

Step 1: Find the total number of cats the pet store had before the sale.
Total number of cats = 38 (Siamese cats) + 25 (House cats) = 63 cats

Step 2: Subtract the number of cats sold during the sale from the total number of cats.
Number of cats left = Total number of cats - Number of cats sold
Number of cats left = 63 - 45 = 18 cats

Therefore, the pet store has 18 cats left after the sale. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 18.

First, we need to find out how many rooms the painter still needs to paint. We know that there are 11 rooms in total, and the painter has already painted 2 rooms. So, the number of rooms left to paint is:

11 - 2 = 9

Next, we need to find out how long it will take the painter to paint these 9 remaining rooms. We know that each room takes 7 hours to paint, so the total time needed to paint 9 rooms is:

9 x 7 = 63 hours

Therefore, the painter will take 63 hours to paint the remaining 9 rooms.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of working video games.
To find the number of working video games, we need to subtract the number of non-working games from the total number of games.
Working games = Total games - Non-working games
Working games = 16 - 8
Working games = 8

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings.
To calculate the total earnings, we need to multiply the number of working games by the selling price per game.
Total earnings = Number of working games x Selling price per game
Total earnings = 8 x $7
Total earnings = $56

Therefore, Mike could earn $56 by selling the working video games. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $56.

Q: For the school bake sale Wendy made pastries. She baked 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies. After the sale she had 24 to take back home. How many pastries did she sell?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many pastries Wendy made in total. We know she made 4 cupcakes and 29 cookies, so:

Total pastries = 4 cupcakes + 29 cookies

Next, we need to subtract the number of pastries she took back home from the total number of pastries she made:

Pastries sold = Total pastries - Pastries taken back home

We know she took back 24 pastries, so:

Pastries sold = Total pastries - 24

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

Pastries sold = (4 cupcakes + 29 cookies) - 24

We can simplify this by adding the cupcakes and cookies together first:

Pastries sold = 33 pastries - 24

Finally, we can subtract 24 from 33 to get the answer:

Pastries sold = 9 pastries

Therefore, Wendy sold 9 pastries at the bake sale. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new ones were brought in. 

Total number of puppies = 17 + 55 = 72

Next, we need to find the number of puppies that still need to be adopted. 

Number of puppies to be adopted = 72 - (8 x number of days)

We can set this expression equal to zero to find the number of days it will take for all the puppies to be adopted. 

72 - (8 x number of days) = 0

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

8 x number of days = 72

Dividing both sides by 8, we get: 

Number of days = 9

Therefore, it will take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted if 8 puppies are adopted each day. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

Q: Haley was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 56 seeds and planted 35 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 3 seeds each. How many small gardens did Haley have?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we know that Haley started with 56 seeds.

Then, she planted 35 of them in the big garden.

So, she has 56 - 35 = 21 seeds left.

Next, we know that she put 3 seeds in each of her small gardens.

Let's use "x" to represent the number of small gardens she has.

So, the total number of seeds she planted in the small gardens is 3x.

We know that the total number of seeds she planted is 35 + 3x.

And we also know that the total number of seeds she planted is 56 - the number of seeds she has left.

So, we can set up an equation:

35 + 3x = 56 - 21

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3x = 35

x = 35/3

However, we can't have a fraction of a garden, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Haley had 12 small gardens. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12.

Q: A chef needs to cook 15 potatoes. He has already cooked 8. If each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how many potatoes the chef still needs to cook. We can do this by subtracting the number of potatoes he has already cooked from the total number of potatoes he needs to cook:

15 - 8 = 7

So the chef still needs to cook 7 potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes to cook one potato. We know that each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, so we can use that information to find out how long it will take to cook 7 potatoes:

7 x 9 = 63

So it will take the chef 63 minutes to cook the remaining 7 potatoes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 63.

Q: A vase can hold 6 flowers. If you had 7 carnations and 47 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many flowers we have in total. We have 7 carnations and 47 roses, so:

7 + 47 = 54

We have 54 flowers in total. 

Next, we need to figure out how many vases we need. We know that each vase can hold 6 flowers, so we can divide the total number of flowers by 6:

54 ÷ 6 = 9

We need 9 vases to hold all the flowers. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

Q: Sarah was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 21 seeds and planted 12 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 3 seeds each. How many small gardens did Sarah have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Sarah started with 21 seeds. 

Then, she planted 12 of them in the big garden. 

So, she had 21 - 12 = 9 seeds left. 

We also know that she put 3 seeds in each of her small gardens. 

To find out how many small gardens she had, we can divide the remaining seeds by 3: 

9 ÷ 3 = 3 

Therefore, Sarah had 3 small gardens. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: Ned had to wash 9 short sleeve shirts and 21 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 29 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Find the total number of shirts Ned had to wash.
To find the total number of shirts, we add the number of short sleeve shirts and the number of long sleeve shirts.
Total number of shirts = 9 + 21 = 30

Step 2: Find the number of shirts Ned washed.
We are given that Ned washed 29 shirts before school started.

Step 3: Find the number of shirts Ned did not wash.
To find the number of shirts Ned did not wash, we subtract the number of shirts he washed from the total number of shirts.
Number of shirts not washed = Total number of shirts - Number of shirts washed
Number of shirts not washed = 30 - 29
Number of shirts not washed = 1

Therefore, Ned did not wash 1 shirt. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: Frank had saved up 3 dollars. If he received another 37 dollars for his allowance, how many 8 dollar toys could he buy?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Frank has $3 and receives an additional $37 for his allowance, so he has a total of $40.

To find out how many 8 dollar toys he can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy.

So, we can set up the equation:

$40 ÷ $8 = ?

Simplifying this equation, we get:

5 = ?

Therefore, Frank can buy 5 8-dollar toys with his $40. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

Q: Paige had 27 files on her computer. She deleted 9 of them and put the rest into folders with 6 files in each one. How many folders did Paige end up with?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many files Paige had left after deleting 9 files. 

27 - 9 = 18 

Paige had 18 files left. 

Next, we need to find out how many folders Paige can make with 6 files in each one. 

18 ÷ 6 = 3 

Paige can make 3 folders with 6 files in each one. 

Therefore, Paige ended up with 3 folders. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: Isabel had 2 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading homework. If each page had 5 problems on it, how many problems did she have to complete total?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many problems are on the math homework. We know that Isabel had 2 pages of math homework, and each page had 5 problems on it. So, she had 2 x 5 = 10 math problems.

Next, we need to find out how many problems are on the reading homework. We know that Isabel had 4 pages of reading homework, and each page had 5 problems on it. So, she had 4 x 5 = 20 reading problems.

Finally, we can add the number of math problems and reading problems together to find the total number of problems Isabel had to complete. 

10 (math problems) + 20 (reading problems) = 30 problems total 

Therefore, Isabel had to complete 30 problems in total. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 30.

Q: Chloe was playing a video game where she scores 9 points for each treasure she finds. If she found 6 treasures on the first level and 3 on the second, what would her score be?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

Chloe found 6 treasures on the first level, and each treasure is worth 9 points. So her score for the first level would be:

6 treasures x 9 points per treasure = 54 points

Next, Chloe found 3 treasures on the second level, and each treasure is worth 9 points. So her score for the second level would be:

3 treasures x 9 points per treasure = 27 points

To find Chloe's total score, we just need to add up her scores from both levels:

54 points (from the first level) + 27 points (from the second level) = 81 points

Therefore, Chloe's total score would be 81 points. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 81.
