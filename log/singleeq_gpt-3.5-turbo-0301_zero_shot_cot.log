Q: A spaceship traveled 0.5 of a light-year from Earth to Planet X and 0.1 of a light-year from Planet X to Planet Y. Then it traveled 0.1 of a light-year from Planet Y back to Earth. How many light-years did the spaceship travel in all?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the spaceship traveled 0.5 light-years from Earth to Planet X.

Then, it traveled 0.1 light-years from Planet X to Planet Y.

Finally, it traveled 0.1 light-years from Planet Y back to Earth.

To find the total distance traveled, we can add up these three distances:

0.5 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.7

Therefore, the spaceship traveled a total of 0.7 light-years. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.7.

Q: During a visit to an orchard, Charlie picked 0.16666666666666666 of a bag of Golden Delicious apples, 0.16666666666666666 of a bag of Macintosh apples, and 0.3333333333333333 of a bag of Cortland apples. How many bags of fruit did Charlie pick in total?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add up the fractions of bags that Charlie picked:

0.16666666666666666 + 0.16666666666666666 + 0.3333333333333333 = 0.6666666666666666

This means that Charlie picked 0.6666666666666666 of a bag of fruit in total. However, we want to know how many bags of fruit Charlie picked, so we need to convert this fraction to a whole number. 

To do this, we can divide the fraction by the size of one bag:

0.6666666666666666 รท 1 = 0.6666666666666666

So Charlie picked 0.6666666666666666 bags of fruit in total. 

However, we usually express the answer in a more understandable way. Therefore, we can round the answer to the nearest hundredth:

0.67 bags of fruit. 

Therefore, Charlie picked 0.67 bags of fruit in total. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.67 bags of fruit.

Q: Megan had 217 markers. Robert gave her 109 more markers. How many markers does Megan have altogether?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we start with Megan having 217 markers.

Then, Robert gave her 109 more markers.

To find out how many markers Megan has altogether, we need to add the number of markers she had originally to the number of markers Robert gave her.

So, we can write it as:

217 + 109 = ?

Now, we just need to add the two numbers together:

217 + 109 = 326

Therefore, Megan has 326 markers altogether. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 326.

We know that there are 5 clown mobiles, and each mobile is stuffed with 28 clowns. So, to find the total number of clowns in all the mobiles combined, we need to multiply the number of clowns in each mobile by the total number of mobiles.

Therefore, the total number of clowns in all the mobiles combined is:

5 x 28 = 140

So, there are 140 clowns in all the clown mobiles combined. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 140.

First, we know that it rained 0.9 inches on Monday. 

Next, we need to figure out how much it rained on Tuesday. We know that it rained 0.7 inches less than on Monday. 

To find out how much it rained on Tuesday, we can subtract 0.7 from 0.9: 

0.9 - 0.7 = 0.2 

So it rained 0.2 inches on Tuesday. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.2 inches.

First, we need to find out how much more brown sugar Victor used compared to white sugar. To do this, we need to subtract the amount of white sugar from the amount of brown sugar:

0.625 - 0.25 = 0.375

So Victor used 0.375 more brown sugar than white sugar.

Therefore, the answer to the question "How much more brown sugar did Victor use?" is 0.375.

Q: The value of a sport utility vehicle this year is 16,000 dollars , which is 0.8 of what its value was last year. How much is the value of the vehicle last year?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume that the value of the vehicle last year was "x" dollars.

According to the problem, the value of the vehicle this year is 0.8 times the value of the vehicle last year.

So, we can write an equation as follows:

16,000 = 0.8x

To find the value of x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.8:

x = 16,000 รท 0.8

x = 20,000

Therefore, the value of the vehicle last year was 20,000 dollars. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 20,000.

How many leftover tarts did the restaurant have in all?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to add up the fractions of tarts filled with each type of fruit:

0.08333333333333333 (cherries) + 0.75 (blueberries) + 0.08333333333333333 (peaches) = 0.9166666666666667

This means that the restaurant had 0.9166666666666667 of a tart leftover.

To find out how many whole tarts this is, we can divide by the fraction of a whole tart that we have:

0.9166666666666667 รท 1 = 0.9166666666666667

So the restaurant had 0.9166666666666667 tarts leftover. But we can't have a fraction of a tart, so we need to round to the nearest whole number. Since the fraction is closer to 1 than it is to 0, we'll round up:

0.9166666666666667 rounded up is 1

Therefore, the restaurant had 1 leftover tart in total. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: The junior ranger asked Christian to help him place 420 seedlings in packets. If every packet needs to contain 7 seeds, how many packets do they need?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that there are 420 seedlings that need to be placed in packets. And each packet needs to contain 7 seeds. 

To find out how many packets they need, we can divide the total number of seedlings by the number of seeds per packet. 

So, 

420 รท 7 = 60 

Therefore, they need 60 packets to place all 420 seedlings. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 60.

Q: Oceanside Bike Rental Shop charges 17 dollars plus 7 dollars an hour for renting a bike. Tom paid 80 dollars to rent a bike. How many hours did he pay to have the bike checked out ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we know that the rental shop charges a flat fee of $17, regardless of how long the bike is rented for. So we can subtract that from the total amount Tom paid to find out how much he paid for the hourly rate:

$80 - $17 = $63

Now we know that Tom paid $7 per hour for the bike rental. To find out how many hours he rented the bike for, we can divide the amount he paid for the hourly rate by the hourly rate itself:

$63 รท $7 = 9

So Tom rented the bike for 9 hours. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

Step 4: So, the number of people at the second concert would be:

65899 + 119 = 66018

Therefore, there were 66018 people at the second concert. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 66018.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, let's find out how much Fred spent in total. 

Fred paid $5.92 for each of the 2 tickets, so the total cost of the tickets is: 

$5.92 x 2 = $11.84 

He also borrowed a movie for $6.79. 

So the total cost of the tickets and the borrowed movie is: 

$11.84 + $6.79 = $18.63 

Fred paid with a $20 bill, so we need to find out how much change he received. 

To do this, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid: 

$20 - $18.63 = $1.37 

Therefore, Fred received $1.37 in change. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $1.37.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total distance Craig traveled. To do this, we add the distance he rode on the bus (3.8333333333333335 miles) to the distance he walked (0.16666666666666666 miles):

Total distance = 3.8333333333333335 + 0.16666666666666666
Total distance = 4 miles

Next, we need to find how much farther Craig rode than walked. To do this, we subtract the distance he walked from the total distance he traveled:

Distance rode - Distance walked = Total distance
Distance rode - 0.16666666666666666 = 4
Distance rode = 4 + 0.16666666666666666
Distance rode = 4.166666666666667 miles

Therefore, Craig rode 4.166666666666667 miles and walked 0.16666666666666666 miles. He rode 4 miles farther than he walked.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the total number of candies in the jar.
Given that there were 3409 pieces of candy in the jar.

Step 2: Find the number of red candies.
Given that 145 pieces were red.

Step 3: Subtract the number of red candies from the total number of candies to find the number of blue candies.
This will give us the answer to the question, "how many were blue?"

Let's solve the problem using these steps.

Step 1: Total number of candies = 3409

Step 2: Number of red candies = 145

Step 3: Number of blue candies = Total number of candies - Number of red candies
                                      = 3409 - 145
                                      = 3264

Therefore, there were 3264 blue candies in the jar.

Q: The library is divided into different sections for different type of books. The science fiction section has 8 books. If each book has 478 pages, how many pages do all the books have in total?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of pages in one book. We know that each book has 478 pages.

So, the total number of pages in all 8 books can be found by multiplying the number of pages in one book by the number of books:

Total number of pages = 8 x 478

Now, we can simply multiply 8 and 478 to get the answer:

Total number of pages = 3824

Therefore, the total number of pages in all 8 science fiction books is 3824. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3824.

Q: Alyssa spent half of her allowance going to the movies. She washed the family car and earned 8 dollars. What is her weekly allowance if she ended with 12 dollars ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Alyssa spent half of her allowance at the movies. So, if we let her weekly allowance be "x", then she spent x/2 at the movies.

Next, we know that she earned 8 dollars by washing the family car. So, her total earnings for the week are x/2 + 8.

Finally, we know that she ended the week with 12 dollars. So, we can set up an equation:

x/2 + 8 = 12

To solve for x, we can subtract 8 from both sides:

x/2 = 4

And then multiply both sides by 2:

x = 8

Therefore, Alyssa's weekly allowance is 8 dollars. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

Q: There are 22 walnut trees currently in the park. Park workers will plant more walnut trees today. When the workers are finished there will be 55 walnut trees in the park. How many walnut trees did the workers plant today ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together. 

We know that there are currently 22 walnut trees in the park. 

We also know that after the workers are finished planting more trees, there will be a total of 55 walnut trees in the park. 

So, to find out how many walnut trees the workers planted today, we can subtract the number of trees that were already in the park from the total number of trees after the workers finished planting. 

That is: 

55 (total number of trees after planting) - 22 (number of trees already in the park) = 

33 

Therefore, the workers planted 33 walnut trees today. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 33.

We know that 7 students rode the rollercoaster every 5 minutes. So, we can find out how many students rode the rollercoaster in 1 minute by dividing 7 by 5.

7 students / 5 minutes = 1.4 students per minute

Now, we can use this information to find out how many students rode the rollercoaster in 15 minutes. We just need to multiply the number of students per minute by the number of minutes.

1.4 students per minute x 15 minutes = 21 students

Therefore, 21 students rode the rollercoaster in 15 minutes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 21.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how many feet Mrs. Hilt will walk in one trip to the water fountain. We know that the distance from her desk to the water fountain is 30 feet, so that's the distance she will walk one way.

To find out the total distance she will walk in one trip, we need to multiply the one-way distance by 2 (since she will have to walk back to her desk as well). So, the total distance she will walk in one trip is:

30 feet (one way) x 2 = 60 feet (round trip)

Now, we need to find out how many feet she will walk in total if she goes to the water fountain 4 times today. To do this, we need to multiply the total distance she will walk in one trip by the number of trips she will make:

60 feet (round trip) x 4 trips = 240 feet

Therefore, Mrs. Hilt will walk 240 feet if she goes to the water fountain 4 times today.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we know that Trenton earns a base salary of $190 per week.

Next, we know that he earns a commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. This means that his commission can be calculated as 0.04x, where x is his total sales for the week.

To reach his goal of earning at least $500, we can set up an equation:

Total earnings = base salary + commission
$500 = $190 + 0.04x

Now we can solve for x:

$500 - $190 = 0.04x
$310 = 0.04x
x = $7,750

Therefore, Trenton must make at least $7,750 in sales to reach his goal of earning $500 for the week. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7750.

Q: Freeport McMoran projects the world grain supply will be 1800000 metric tons and the supply will be only 0.75 of the world grain demand. What will the world grain demand be?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Given, the world grain supply = 1800000 metric tons

Let's assume the world grain demand as 'x' metric tons.

According to the problem, the supply is only 0.75 of the demand.

So, we can write the equation as:

1800000 = 0.75x

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.

Dividing both sides by 0.75, we get:

x = 1800000 / 0.75

x = 2400000

Therefore, the world grain demand will be 2400000 metric tons. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2400000.

Q: For his long distance phone service Milan pays a 2 dollars monthly fee plus 12 cents per minute. Last month , Milan 's long distance bill was 23.36 dollars. For how many minutes was Milan billed for ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we know that Milan pays a fixed monthly fee of $2. This means that regardless of how many minutes he uses, he will always have to pay $2.

Next, we know that Milan is charged an additional 12 cents per minute. This means that for every minute he uses, he will have to pay an extra 12 cents.

Finally, we know that Milan's long distance bill for last month was $23.36. This includes both the fixed monthly fee of $2 and the additional charges for the minutes he used.

To find out how many minutes Milan was billed for, we need to subtract the fixed monthly fee from the total bill and then divide the result by the cost per minute.

So, the calculation would be:

Total bill - Fixed monthly fee = Additional charges for minutes
$23.36 - $2 = $21.36

Additional charges for minutes / Cost per minute = Number of minutes billed
$21.36 / $0.12 = 178

Therefore, Milan was billed for 178 minutes last month. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 178.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find the total fraction of garments that are either bikinis or trunks. To do this, we can add the fraction of bikinis to the fraction of trunks:

0.375 (bikinis) + 0.25 (trunks) = 0.625

So, 0.625 of the garments are either bikinis or trunks.

We can also express this as a fraction by simplifying:

0.625 = 625/1000

To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 125:

625/1000 = (625 รท 125) / (1000 รท 125) = 5/8

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Let's call the amount of money in Christina's account before the transfer "x".

We know that she transferred $69 out of her account, so we can subtract that from x:

x - $69

We also know that after the transfer, there was $26,935 left in the account. So we can set up an equation:

x - $69 = $26,935

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding $69 to both sides:

x - $69 + $69 = $26,935 + $69

Simplifying:

x = $27,004

So there was $27,004 in Christina's account before the transfer.

First, we need to find out how much money Joan gave to the cashier. We know that the cage cost her $10.97 and she paid with a $20 bill, so we can subtract the cost of the cage from the amount she paid:

$20.00 - $10.97 = $9.03

So Joan gave the cashier $9.03.

Next, we need to add the cost of the cat toy to the amount Joan gave the cashier:

$9.03 + $8.77 = $17.80

So the total cost of the cat toy and the cage is $17.80.

Finally, we need to find out how much change Joan received. To do this, we can subtract the total cost from the amount Joan gave the cashier:

$20.00 - $17.80 = $2.20

The next odd number would be "x + 2" (since we know that consecutive odd numbers are 2 apart from each other). 

And the third odd number would be "x + 4". 

Now we can use the information given in the problem to set up an equation: 

x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 69 

Simplifying this equation: 

3x + 6 = 69 

Subtracting 6 from both sides:

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

First, we know that when Jake had one cat, he needed to serve 0.5 of a can of cat food each day. So, we can represent this as:

1 cat = 0.5 can/day

Next, we know that Jake has adopted a second cat and now needs to serve a total of 0.9 of a can each day. We can represent this as:

2 cats = 0.9 can/day

To find out how much extra food is needed to feed the second cat, we can subtract the amount of food needed for one cat from the total amount of food needed for two cats:

0.9 can/day - 0.5 can/day = 0.4 can/day

Therefore, Jake needs an extra 0.4 of a can of cat food each day to feed the second cat.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume the height of the shortest player as "x" inches.

According to the problem, the tallest player is 9.5 inches taller than the shortest player. So, the height of the tallest player can be represented as:

x + 9.5 inches

But we also know that the height of the tallest player is given as 77.75 inches. So, we can set up an equation:

x + 9.5 = 77.75

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 9.5 from both sides:

x = 77.75 - 9.5

x = 68.25

Therefore, the shortest player is 68.25 inches tall. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 68.25 inches.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Benny spent on candy bars. We know that he spent a total of 27 dollars and 2 dollars on the soft drink, so we can subtract 2 from 27 to get the amount he spent on candy bars:

27 - 2 = 25

So Benny spent 25 dollars on candy bars. 

Next, we need to figure out how many candy bars he bought. We know he bought 5 candy bars, so we can divide the total amount he spent on candy bars by the number of candy bars:

25 / 5 = 5

So each candy bar cost 5 dollars. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

Q: Nancy has saved 1 dozen quarters from washing cars.  How much money does Nancy have ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to know how many quarters are in a dozen. 

A dozen is equal to 12, so there are 12 quarters in a dozen. 

Next, we need to multiply the number of dozens Nancy has saved by the number of quarters in a dozen. 

1 dozen x 12 quarters/dozen = 12 quarters 

Therefore, Nancy has 12 quarters. 

To find out how much money Nancy has, we need to know the value of one quarter. 

One quarter is equal to $0.25. 

So, to find out how much money Nancy has, we need to multiply the number of quarters she has by the value of one quarter. 

12 quarters x $0.25/quarter = $3.00 

Therefore, Nancy has $3.00. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $3.00.

We know the total number of games (12) and the number of months (2), so we can rearrange the equation to solve for the number of games per month:

Number of games per month = Total number of games / Number of months

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

Number of games per month = 12 / 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Number of games per month = 6

Q: So far, an orchard has sold a combined total of 9,792 pounds of fresh and frozen fruit this season. If they have sold 3,513 pounds of frozen fruit, how many pounds of fresh fruit have been sold so far?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the total amount of fruit sold
To find the total amount of fruit sold, we need to add the amount of fresh fruit sold to the amount of frozen fruit sold. So, we can write:

Total fruit sold = Fresh fruit sold + Frozen fruit sold

We know that the total amount of fruit sold is 9,792 pounds and the amount of frozen fruit sold is 3,513 pounds. So, we can substitute these values in the above equation:

9,792 = Fresh fruit sold + 3,513

Step 2: Solve for Fresh fruit sold
To solve for Fresh fruit sold, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3,513 from both sides of the equation:

9,792 - 3,513 = Fresh fruit sold + 3,513 - 3,513

Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get:

9,792 - 3,513 = Fresh fruit sold

So, the amount of fresh fruit sold so far is:

Fresh fruit sold = 9,792 - 3,513 = 6,279 pounds

Therefore, 6 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6,279 pounds.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how far Darnel sprinted in total. We know that he sprinted 0.875 of a lap, so we can write:

Distance sprinted = 0.875 laps

Next, we need to figure out how far Darnel jogged. We know that he jogged 0.75 of a lap, so we can write:

Distance jogged = 0.75 laps

Finally, we need to subtract the distance jogged from the distance sprinted to find out how much farther Darnel sprinted than jogged. We can write:

Distance farther sprinted = Distance sprinted - Distance jogged

Plugging in the values we found earlier, we get:

Distance farther sprinted = 0.875 laps - 0.75 laps

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Distance farther sprinted = 0.125 laps

Therefore, Darnel sprinted 0.125 laps farther than he jogged.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we can add the number of bottles of lemon-lime soda and cola together to find the total amount of soda they drank. 

2.6666666666666665 + 2.6666666666666665 = 5.333333333333333

So they drank a total of 5.333333333333333 bottles of soda. 

However, since we're dealing with fractions of bottles, it might be helpful to convert this to a mixed number or a decimal. 

To convert to a mixed number, we can divide the numerator (top number) by the denominator (bottom number) and write the result as a whole number plus a fraction. 

5.333333333333333 รท 1 = 5 with a remainder of 0.333333333333333

So the mixed number is 5 and 1/3 bottles of soda. 

To convert to a decimal, we can simply write the number as a decimal. 

5.333333333333333 = 5.3 (rounded to one decimal place) 

So they drank a total of 5.3 bottles of soda. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5.3 bottles of soda.

Q: Janeโs mom picked cherry tomatoes from their backyard. If she gathered 56 cherry tomatoes and is about to place them in small jars which can contain 8 cherry tomatoes at a time, how many jars will she need?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how many groups of 8 cherry tomatoes can be made from the total of 56 cherry tomatoes. We can do this by dividing 56 by 8:

56 รท 8 = 7

This means that there are 7 groups of 8 cherry tomatoes in 56 cherry tomatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many jars are needed to hold these 7 groups of 8 cherry tomatoes. Since each jar can hold 8 cherry tomatoes, we can divide the total number of cherry tomatoes by 8:

56 รท 8 = 7

So, Jane's mom will need 7 jars to hold all the cherry tomatoes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7 jars.

Q: A mechanic charged 45 dollars an hour , plus 225 dollars for the parts. If the total bill was 450 dollars , how many hours did the job take?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume that the number of hours the mechanic worked is "h".

The total cost of the job is given as $450.

Out of this, $225 is for the parts used.

The remaining amount is for the labor charges, which is $450 - $225 = $225.

We know that the mechanic charged $45 per hour for labor.

So, the total number of hours worked can be calculated as:

$225 (labor charges) / $45 (hourly rate) = 5 hours

Therefore, the job took 5 hours to complete. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

Q: On Monday, 375 students went on a trip to the zoo. All 7 buses were filled and 4 students had to travel in cars. How many students were in each bus ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of students who went on the trip. We know that 375 students went on the trip, and 4 of them traveled in cars. So, the total number of students who traveled by bus is:

375 - 4 = 371

Next, we need to find out how many students were in each bus. We know that there were 7 buses in total, so we can divide the total number of students who traveled by bus by the number of buses:

371 รท 7 = 53

Therefore, there were 53 students in each bus. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 53.

Q: A restaurant sold 63 hamburgers last week. How many hamburgers on average were sold each day ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

To find the average number of hamburgers sold per day, we need to divide the total number of hamburgers sold by the number of days in the week.

So, if the restaurant sold 63 hamburgers in a week, and there are 7 days in a week, we can divide 63 by 7 to get the average number of hamburgers sold per day.

63 รท 7 = 9

Therefore, the restaurant sold an average of 9 hamburgers per day. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

Q: A restaurant served 5 cakes during lunch and 6 during dinner today. The restaurant served 3 cakes yesterday. How many cakes were served in total ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to add up the number of cakes served during lunch and dinner today:

5 cakes + 6 cakes = 11 cakes

Next, we need to add the number of cakes served yesterday:

11 cakes + 3 cakes = 14 cakes

Therefore, the total number of cakes served is 14. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

Q: Priya needs 54 cupcakes for a birthday party. She already has 15 chocolate cupcakes and 25 vanilla cupcakes. How many more cupcakes should Priya buy?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the total number of cupcakes Priya already has.
Priya already has 15 chocolate cupcakes and 25 vanilla cupcakes.
Total cupcakes Priya already has = 15 + 25 = 40 cupcakes.

Step 2: Find the number of cupcakes Priya needs to buy.
Priya needs 54 cupcakes for the birthday party.
Number of cupcakes Priya needs to buy = 54 - 40 = 14 cupcakes.

Therefore, Priya should buy 14 more cupcakes for the birthday party. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

Q: Joan has 9 blue balloons, Sally has 5 blue balloons, and Jessica has 2 blue balloons. How many blue balloons do they have in total ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to add up the number of blue balloons each person has: 

Joan: 9 blue balloons 
Sally: 5 blue balloons 
Jessica: 2 blue balloons 

Next, we can add those numbers together: 

9 + 5 + 2 = 16 

So in total, they have 16 blue balloons. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 16.

Q: Jason's shelves hold 45 books each. How many shelves will Jason need if Jason has 315 books?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many shelves Jason needs to hold one book. To do this, we can divide the total number of books by the number of books each shelf can hold:

315 books รท 45 books per shelf = 7 shelves

So Jason will need 7 shelves to hold all 315 books. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

Q: Sandy sold lemonade in her neighborhood. She got 17 half-dollars on Saturday and 6 half-dollars on Sunday. What amount of money did Sandy receive?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to figure out how much each half-dollar is worth. 

Since a half-dollar is worth 50 cents, we can multiply the number of half-dollars by 50 cents to find the total amount of money Sandy received. 

So, for Saturday: 

17 half-dollars x 50 cents/half-dollar = 850 cents 

And for Sunday: 

6 half-dollars x 50 cents/half-dollar = 300 cents 

To find the total amount of money Sandy received, we can add the amounts from Saturday and Sunday: 

850 cents + 300 cents = 1150 cents 

So Sandy received 1150 cents, which is equal to $11.50. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $11.50.

Q: The sum of three consecutive even numbers is 162. What is the smallest of the three numbers ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's start by defining the three consecutive even numbers. Let's call the smallest even number "x". 

The next even number would be "x + 2" because it is consecutive and even. 

The third even number would be "x + 4" because it is also consecutive and even. 

Now we can set up an equation using the information given in the problem: 

x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 162 

Simplifying the equation: 

3x + 6 = 162 

Subtracting 6 from both sides: 

3x = 156 

Dividing both sides by 3: 

x = 52 

Therefore, the smallest of the three consecutive even numbers is 52. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 52.

Q: Pamela bought 9.8 ounces of sugar, and she spilled 5.2 ounces of it on the floor. How much is left?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how much sugar Pamela has left after spilling 5.2 ounces. 

To do this, we can subtract 5.2 from 9.8: 

9.8 - 5.2 = 4.6 

So Pamela has 4.6 ounces of sugar left. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.6 ounces.

Q: Benny goes to lunch with Sally and Sandy. The total bill came to 15 dollars. They decided to equally split up the bill, how much will each person have to pay ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

Step 1: Find the total number of people who are splitting the bill.
In this case, Benny, Sally, and Sandy are splitting the bill, so there are three people.

Step 2: Divide the total bill by the number of people.
To find out how much each person has to pay, we need to divide the total bill by the number of people. So, 15 dollars divided by 3 people is 5 dollars per person.

Step 3: Answer the question.
Therefore, each person will have to pay 5 dollars.

Q: Dina made cookies. She used 0.625 of a cup of flour and 0.25 of a cup of sugar. How much more flour than sugar did Dina use?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the difference between the amount of flour and sugar used. To do this, we can subtract the amount of sugar used from the amount of flour used:

0.625 - 0.25 = 0.375

So Dina used 0.375 more cups of flour than sugar. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.375.

Q: Dana earns $13 per hour. She worked 9 hours on Friday, 10 hours on Saturday, and 3 hours on Sunday. How much money did Dana earn in all?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate how many hours Dana worked in total. We can do this by adding up the hours she worked on each day:

9 hours + 10 hours + 3 hours = 22 hours

So Dana worked a total of 22 hours.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Dana earned per hour:

$13 per hour

Finally, we can calculate how much money Dana earned in total by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours she worked:

$13 per hour x 22 hours = $286

Therefore, Dana earned $286 in total. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $286.

Q: There were a total of 7 football games this year. Melanie missed 4 of the games. How many football games did Melanie go to in all ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that there were a total of 7 football games this year.

Next, we know that Melanie missed 4 of the games.

To find out how many football games Melanie went to in all, we can subtract the number of games she missed from the total number of games:

7 - 4 = 3

So Melanie went to 3 football games in all. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: Gordon bought 3.42 pounds of fruit for a class party. The class ate 2.2 pounds of the fruit. How much fruit is left?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the amount of fruit Gordon had initially.
Gordon bought 3.42 pounds of fruit.

Step 2: Find the amount of fruit the class ate.
The class ate 2.2 pounds of the fruit.

Step 3: Find the amount of fruit left.
To find the amount of fruit left, we need to subtract the amount of fruit the class ate from the initial amount of fruit Gordon bought.
Amount of fruit left = 3.42 - 2.2
Amount of fruit left = 1.22 pounds

Therefore, there is 1.22 pounds of fruit left. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.22 pounds.

Q: Mike worked 3 hours, each day, for 5 days. How many hours did he work in total ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how many hours Mike worked each day. We know that he worked for 3 hours each day.

Next, we need to find out how many days he worked. We know that he worked for 5 days.

To find out how many hours he worked in total, we can multiply the number of hours he worked each day by the number of days he worked. So:

3 hours/day x 5 days = 15 hours

Therefore, Mike worked for a total of 15 hours. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 15.

Q: Manuel opened a savings account with an initial deposit of 177 dollars. If he wants to save 500 dollars during the next 19 weeks , how much must he save each week , in dollars?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we need to find out how much Manuel wants to save in total. We know that he wants to save 500 dollars during the next 19 weeks, so we can divide 500 by 19 to find out how much he needs to save each week.

500 / 19 = 26.32

So Manuel needs to save approximately 26.32 dollars each week to reach his goal of saving 500 dollars in 19 weeks.

However, we also need to take into account his initial deposit of 177 dollars. This means that he only needs to save the remaining amount to reach his goal.

500 - 177 = 323

So Manuel needs to save a total of 323 dollars over the next 19 weeks. Dividing this by 19 gives us:

323 / 19 = 17

Therefore, Manuel needs to save 17 dollars each week to reach his goal of saving 500 dollars in 19 weeks, after taking into account his initial deposit of 177 dollars. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 17.

Q: Sara, Keith, Benny, and Alyssa each have 96 baseball cards.  How many dozen baseball cards do they have in all?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of baseball cards they have altogether. To do this, we can add up the number of cards each person has:

96 + 96 + 96 + 96 = 384

So, they have a total of 384 baseball cards.

Next, we need to convert this number to dozens. Since there are 12 cards in a dozen, we can divide 384 by 12:

384 รท 12 = 32

Therefore, they have 32 dozen baseball cards in all. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 32.

We know that there were a total of 323 football games in the season, and the season is played for 17 months. We want to find out how many football games were played each month, assuming that each month has the same number of games. 

To solve this problem, we can use division. We can divide the total number of games by the number of months to find the average number of games played per month. 

So, the calculation would be: 

323 games รท 17 months = 19 games per month

Q: Mary loves eating fruits. Mary paid $7.19 for berries, and $6.83 for peaches with a $20 bill. How much change did Mary receive?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the fruits that Mary bought. 

Total cost = cost of berries + cost of peaches 

Total cost = $7.19 + $6.83 

Total cost = $13.02 

Next, we need to find how much money Mary gave to the cashier. 

Amount paid = $20 

Now, we can find the change that Mary received. 

Change = amount paid - total cost 

Change = $20 - $13.02 

Change = $6.98 

Therefore, Mary received $6.98 in change. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $6.98.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total amount of money Tim got from shining shoes. To do this, we need to find the value of 3 nickels and 13 dimes.

The value of 3 nickels is 3 x $0.05 = $0.15.

The value of 13 dimes is 13 x $0.10 = $1.30.

So, the total amount of money Tim got from shining shoes is $0.15 + $1.30 = $1.45.

Next, we need to find the total amount of money Tim got from tips. To do this, we need to find the value of 7 dimes and 9 half-dollars.

The value of 7 dimes is 7 x $0.10 = $0.70.

The value of 9 half-dollars is 9 x $0.50 = $4.50.

So, the total amount of money Tim got from tips is $0.70 + $4.50 = $5.20.

Finally, we need to find the total amount of money Tim got. To do this, we need to add the amount of money

Q: Fred has 110 blue marbles. Fred has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim. How many blue marbles does Tim have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between Fred's and Tim's marbles. Let x be the number of blue marbles Tim has. Then, according to the problem, we know that:

Fred's blue marbles = 110
Tim's blue marbles = x

And we also know that Fred has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim. This means that:

Fred's blue marbles = 22 * Tim's blue marbles

Now we can substitute the values we know into the equation:

110 = 22x

Solving for x, we can divide both sides by 22:

x = 5

Q: Sean has 223 whistles. Sean has 95 more whistles than Charles. How many whistles does Charles have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent the relationship between Sean's and Charles' number of whistles. Let's say that Charles has x whistles. Then we know that Sean has 95 more whistles than Charles, so Sean has x + 95 whistles.

We also know that Sean has 223 whistles, so we can set up an equation:

x + 95 = 223

To solve for x, we can subtract 95 from both sides:

x = 223 - 95

x = 128

Therefore, Charles has 128 whistles. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 128.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Mrs. Hilt spent a total of 74 cents at the school store.

Next, we know that she bought a notebook for 35 cents and a ruler for 18 cents. So, the total cost of the notebook and ruler is:

35 cents + 18 cents = 53 cents

We also know that she bought 3 pencils, but we don't know the cost of one pencil yet. Let's call the cost of one pencil "x". 

So, the total cost of the pencils is:

3x

Now we can set up an equation to solve for "x":

53 cents + 3x = 74 cents

To solve for "x", we can start by subtracting 53 cents from both sides:

3x = 21 cents

Finally, we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for "x":

x = 7 cents

Therefore, the cost of one pencil is 7 cents. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

Kaleen filled a bucket with 0.75 of a gallon of water. 

This means that initially, the bucket had 0.75 gallons of water in it.

A few minutes later, she realized only 0.5 of a gallon of water remained.

This means that after some time, the bucket had only 0.5 gallons of water left in it.

Now, we need to find out how much water leaked out of the bucket.

To do this, we can subtract the amount of water remaining from the initial amount of water.

0.75 - 0.5 = 0.25

Therefore, 0.25 gallons of water leaked out of the bucket. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0.25 gallons.

She sold half of them, which means she sold x/2 comic books.

After selling half, she bought 6 more, which means she now has x/2 + 6 comic books.

And we know that she now has 13 comic books.

So we can set up an equation: 

x/2 + 6 = 13

Now we can solve for x:

x/2 = 7

x = 14

Therefore, Sandy began with 14 comic books.

First, we know that they harvest 83 sacks per day. 

So, in one day, they will have 83 sacks of oranges. 

To find out how many sacks of oranges they will have after 6 days of harvest, we need to multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of days they are harvesting. 

So, 83 sacks per day multiplied by 6 days of harvest is:

To find the total number of students, we can multiply the number of students at one table by the number of tables. So, 6 students x 34 tables = 204 students.

Therefore, there were 204 students sitting in the lunchroom. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 204.

Q: To fill an order, the factory dyed 61,921 yards of silk green and 49,500 yards pink. How many yards of silk did it dye for that order?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total yards of silk dyed for the order. To do that, we need to add the yards of green silk and pink silk dyed.

Total yards of silk dyed = yards of green silk dyed + yards of pink silk dyed

Total yards of silk dyed = 61,921 + 49,500

Total yards of silk dyed = 111,421

Therefore, the factory dyed 111,421 yards of silk for that order. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 111,421.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we add the cost of the trumpet and the song book: 

$145.16 + $5.84 = $151 

So Mike spent $151 at the music store. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $151.

Q: Fred has 5 baseball cards. Melanie bought 3 of Fred's  baseball cards. How many baseball cards does Fred have now ?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to subtract the number of baseball cards that Melanie bought from the total number of baseball cards that Fred had. 

Fred had 5 baseball cards. 

Melanie bought 3 of Fred's baseball cards. 

So, we need to subtract 3 from 5: 

5 - 3 = 2 

Therefore, Fred now has 2 baseball cards. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

Q: The farmer had 127 apples. The farmer gave 88 apples to his neighbor. How many apples does the farmer have now?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we start with the number of apples the farmer had, which is 127. 

Next, we need to subtract the number of apples the farmer gave to his neighbor, which is 88. 

So, the equation would be: 

127 - 88 = 

Now we can solve for the answer: 

127 - 88 = 39 

Therefore, the farmer now has 39 apples left after giving 88 apples to his neighbor. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 39.

Q: There was a stack of 700 sheets of used paper. Lexie wants to place it in boxes for recycling. If every box can contain 100 sheets, how many boxes does Lexie need?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to figure out how many boxes can be filled with 100 sheets each. We can do this by dividing the total number of sheets by 100:

700 / 100 = 7

So, there are 7 boxes that can be filled with 100 sheets each.

However, we also need to consider any leftover sheets that cannot fit into a full box. To do this, we can use the modulo operator (%), which gives us the remainder after division:

700 % 100 = 0

Since the remainder is 0, we know that all 700 sheets can fit perfectly into the 7 boxes. Therefore, Lexie needs 7 boxes for recycling. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

Q: Alyssa's high school played 31 hockey games this year. She attended  13 games. How many hockey games did Alyssa miss ?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

We know that Alyssa attended 13 hockey games out of 31 total games played by her high school team. 

To find out how many games she missed, we can subtract the number of games she attended from the total number of games played:

31 - 13 = 18

Therefore, Alyssa missed 18 hockey games. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 18.

Q: A truck carrying 4.1 pounds of sand travels to a construction yard and loses 2.4 pounds of sand along the way. How much sand does the truck have when it arrives at the yard?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much sand the truck has left after losing 2.4 pounds. We can do this by subtracting 2.4 from 4.1:

4.1 - 2.4 = 1.7

So the truck has 1.7 pounds of sand left when it arrives at the yard. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.7 pounds.
