Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She already put in 10 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cups of sugar Mary still needs to add. To do this, we subtract the amount of sugar she already put in (10 cups) from the total amount of sugar required (12 cups):

12 cups - 10 cups = 2 cups

So Mary still needs to add 2 cups of sugar.

Next, we need to find out how many cups of flour she needs to add. To do this, we subtract the amount of flour she already put in (14 cups) from the total amount of flour required:

14 cups - 0 cups = 14 cups

So Mary needs to add 14 cups of flour.

Finally, we need to find the difference between the amount of flour and the amount of sugar she needs to add. To do this, we subtract the amount of sugar she needs to add (2 cups) from the amount of flour she needs to add (14 cups):

14 cups - 2 cups = 12 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 12 more cups of flour than cups of sugar. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 15 bottle caps and 18 wrappers at the park. Now he has 67 wrappers and 35 bottle caps in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps does danny have now?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found the 15 bottle caps at the park. 

35 (current bottle caps) - 15 (found at the park) = 20 (original bottle caps)

Next, we need to find out how many wrappers Danny had before he found the 18 wrappers at the park. 

67 (current wrappers) - 18 (found at the park) = 49 (original wrappers)

Finally, we can find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has now. 

49 (original wrappers) - 20 (original bottle caps) = 29

Therefore, Danny has 29 more wrappers than bottle caps in his collection now. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 29.

Q: There are 7 baskets of peaches. Each basket has 10 red peaches and 2 green peaches. How many green peaches are in the baskets altogether?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we need to find out how many peaches are in one basket. We know that each basket has 10 red peaches and 2 green peaches, so there are a total of 12 peaches in one basket.

Next, we need to find out how many peaches are in all 7 baskets. To do this, we can multiply the number of peaches in one basket (12) by the number of baskets (7). 

12 x 7 = 84

So there are 84 peaches in all 7 baskets.

Finally, we need to find out how many of those peaches are green. We know that each basket has 2 green peaches, so to find out how many green peaches are in all 7 baskets, we can multiply the number of green peaches in one basket (2) by the number of baskets (7).

2 x 7 = 14

Therefore, there are 14 green peaches in all 7 baskets. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

First, we need to find out how many necklaces Emily still needs to make. We can do this by subtracting the number of necklaces she has already made from the total number of friends she has:

44 friends - 26 necklaces = 18 necklaces left to make

Next, we need to find out how many beads Emily will need to make those remaining 18 necklaces. We know that each necklace takes 2 beads, so we can multiply the number of necklaces by 2:

18 necklaces x 2 beads per necklace = 36 beads

Therefore, Emily will need 36 beads to make the remaining necklaces for her friends. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 36.

12 cups of flour - 2 cups of flour = 10 cups of flour

So Mary still needs to add 10 cups of flour.

Next, we need to find out how many cups of salt the recipe calls for:

7 cups of salt

Now we can find the difference between the number of cups of flour Mary needs to add and the number of cups of salt the recipe calls for:

10 cups of flour - 7 cups of salt = 3 cups

Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of salt.

First, we need to find out the depth of the water. We know that the depth is 10 times Dean's height, which is 9 feet. So, the depth of the water is:

10 x 9 = 90 feet

Next, we need to find out how much deeper the water is than Dean's height. To do this, we simply subtract Dean's height from the depth of the water:

90 - 9 = 81 feet

Therefore, the water is 81 feet deeper than Dean's height.

8 dollars (from mom) + 5 dollars (from dad) = 13 dollars 

Next, we need to subtract the amount she spent: 

13 dollars - 4 dollars (spent) = 9 dollars 

So, Gwen has 9 dollars left. 

Finally, to answer the question, we need to find the difference between the amount she received from her mom and dad: 

8 dollars (from mom) - 5 dollars (from dad) = 3 dollars 

Therefore, Gwen received 3 dollars more from her mom than she did from her dad.

Let's assume that Paul sold x number of books in the garage sale.

According to the problem, he was left with 27 books after the sale.

So, we can write an equation to represent this information:

136 - x = 27

Now, we can solve for x by simplifying the equation:

x = 136 - 27

x = 109

Therefore, Paul sold 109 books in the garage sale. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 109.

Since each Ferris wheel has 19 seats, 20 Ferris wheels will have 20 x 19 = 380 seats in total. 

Next, we need to find the total number of people that can ride on these seats. 

Since each seat can hold 15 people, the total number of people that can ride on 380 seats is 380 x 15 = 5700. 

Therefore, 5700 people can ride on 20 Ferris wheels at the same time.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game. We can do this by subtracting the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold:

186 total t-shirts - 172 t-shirts sold during Arkansas game = 14 t-shirts sold during Texas Tech game

Now that we know they sold 14 t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we can find out how much money they made from selling those t-shirts by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold by the profit per t-shirt:

14 t-shirts sold during Texas Tech game x $78 profit per t-shirt = $1,092

Therefore, they made $1,092 from selling t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

So the Ferris wheel can hold up to 84 people. 

Next, we need to find out how many more people can join the wheel if there are already 16 people on it. To do this, we can subtract the current number of people from the total capacity:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of boxes Shirley needs to deliver. To do this, we can multiply the number of cases by the number of boxes in each case. 

5 cases x ? boxes per case = total number of boxes 

Since we don't know how many boxes are in each case, we can use algebra to solve for the missing value. 

Let's use the variable "x" to represent the number of boxes in each case. 

5x = total number of boxes 

We know that the total number of boxes is 10 (since Shirley sold 10 boxes). 

So we can substitute 10 for "total number of boxes" in the equation: 

5x = 10 

Now we can solve for x: 

5x/5 = 10/5 

x = 2 

Therefore, there are 2 boxes in each case.

So Paul had 95 books left after giving 39 to his friend.

Next, we need to find out how many books Paul sold in the garage sale. We can do this by subtracting the number of books he had left from the number he started with:

134 - 95 = 39

So Paul sold 39 books in the garage sale. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 39.

Q: There are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 345 groups and oranges are organized into 16 groups How big is each group of oranges?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of fruits in Philip's collection:

384 oranges + 192 bananas = 576 fruits

Next, we need to find the number of oranges in each group. We know that there are 16 groups of oranges, so we can divide the total number of oranges by 16:

384 oranges รท 16 groups = 24 oranges per group

Finally, we don't need to worry about the bananas since the question only asks about the size of each group of oranges. Therefore, the answer is:

Each group of oranges has 24 oranges. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 24.

Q: There were some birds sitting on the fence. 4 more birds came to join them. If there are a total of 5 birds on the fence now How many birds had been sitting on the fence at the start?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together. 

We know that there were some birds sitting on the fence at the start. Let's call that number "x". 

Then, 4 more birds came to join them. So the total number of birds on the fence now is "x + 4". 

And we also know that the total number of birds on the fence now is 5. So we can set up an equation: 

x + 4 = 5 

To solve for x, we can subtract 4 from both sides: 

x = 1 

Therefore, there was 1 bird sitting on the fence at the start. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon How many students suggested bacon?
A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assign variables to the unknowns in the problem. Let's call the number of students who suggested adding bacon "x". 

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. We also know that 63 more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon. So, the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes can be expressed as "x + 63". 

We know that the total number of students who made suggestions is the sum of those who suggested mashed potatoes and those who suggested bacon. So, we can set up an equation: 

457 = x + (x + 63) 

Simplifying this equation: 

457 = 2x + 63 

Subtracting 63 from both sides: 

394 = 2x 

Dividing both sides by 2: 

x = 197 

Therefore, 197 students suggested adding bacon to the menu. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 197.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny had before he found the ones at the park. 

Danny had 28 bottle caps and found 71 more, so he had a total of 28 + 71 = 99 bottle caps. 

He also had 16 wrappers and found 24 more, so he had a total of 16 + 24 = 40 wrappers. 

To find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny has now, we need to subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps: 

99 - 40 = 59 

Therefore, Danny has 59 more bottle caps than wrappers in his collection now.

10 invitations/pack x 7 packs = 70 invitations 

Next, we need to figure out how many invitations Carol will use for her two friends: 

2 friends x 1 invitation per friend = 2 invitations 

To find out how many invitations are left, we can subtract the number of invitations used from the total number of invitations bought: 

70 invitations - 2 invitations = 68 invitations left

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 210 dollars off each jersey and $ 240 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total revenue from the sale of jerseys and t-shirts. 

Revenue from jerseys = 23 x $210 = $4,830 
Revenue from t-shirts = 177 x $240 = $42,480 

Total revenue = $4,830 + $42,480 = $47,310 

Next, we need to find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey. 

The profit per jersey is $210, and the profit per t-shirt is $240. 

Therefore, the difference in profit between a t-shirt and a jersey is $240 - $210 = $30. 

So, a t-shirt costs $30 more than a jersey.

First, we need to find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can subtract 3 from Steven's 12 peaches to get:

Jake has 12 - 3 = 9 peaches.

Next, we need to find out how many apples Jake has. We know that Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, so we can add 10 to Steven's 15 apples to get:

Jake has 15 + 10 = 25 apples.

Now that we know how many peaches and apples each person has, we can find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has by subtracting the number of peaches from the number of apples:

Steven has 15 - 12 = 3 more apples than peaches.

So, Steven has 3 more apples than peaches.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of children on the bus after 24 got on. 

23 children were already on the bus, and 24 more got on, so the total number of children on the bus is:

23 + 24 = 47

Next, we need to find how many children got off the bus. We know that there were 8 children left on the bus, so we can subtract that from the total number of children on the bus:

47 - 8 = 39

Therefore, 39 children got off the bus. 

To find how many more children got off than got on, we can subtract the number of children who got on (24) from the number who got off (39):

39 - 24 = 15

So 15 more children got off the bus than got on.

First, we know that Dave started with 7 tickets. 

Next, we know that he used some of those tickets to buy toys. Let's call the number of tickets he used "x". 

So, Dave now has 2 tickets left. 

Putting all of this together, we can create an equation: 

7 - x = 2 

This equation represents the fact that Dave started with 7 tickets, used "x" tickets to buy toys, and now has 2 tickets left. 

To solve for "x", we can simply subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 

7 - x - 2 = 2 - 2 

5 - x = 0 

Now we can add "x" to both sides of the equation: 

5 - x + x = 0 + x 

5 = x 

So Dave used 5 tickets to buy toys. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

Ed = Doug + 10

We also know that Ed had 45 marbles, so we can substitute that in:

45 = Doug + 10

Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get:

Doug = 35

Now we know that Doug had 35 marbles before he lost 11. So after he lost 11, he had:

35 - 11 = 24

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we can subtract their numbers of marbles:

45 - 24 = 21

So Ed had 21 more marbles than Doug.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can start by finding out how many apps Dave had in total before he added any new ones. We can do this by subtracting the number of apps he had left after deleting some from the total number of apps he had:

Total number of apps = 21 + 89 + (number of apps deleted)

We know that he had 24 apps left after deleting some, so we can substitute that in:

24 = 21 + 89 + (number of apps deleted)

Now we can solve for the number of apps deleted:

24 - 21 - 89 = (number of apps deleted)

-86 = (number of apps deleted)

So Dave deleted 86 apps.

To find out how many more apps he added than he deleted, we can subtract the number of apps deleted from the number of new apps he added:

89 - 86 = 3

Therefore, Dave added 3 more apps than he deleted. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace in the past three days. We know that 512 visitors came on the current day, 471 visitors came the previous day, and 808 visitors came the day before that. So, the total number of visitors in the past three days is:

512 + 471 + 808 = 1791

Next, we need to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace on average per day in the past three days. To do this, we divide the total number of visitors by the number of days:

1791 / 3 = 597

So, on average, 597 visitors came to the Buckingham palace per day in the past three days. Finally, we need to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace in the past 89 days. To do this, we multiply the average number of visitors per day by the number of days:

First, we need to find out how many shirts the machine made yesterday. We know that it worked for 5 minutes and can make 6 shirts per minute, so:

Shirts made yesterday = 5 minutes x 6 shirts/minute
Shirts made yesterday = 30 shirts

Next, we need to find out how many shirts the machine made today. We know that it worked for 12 minutes and can make 6 shirts per minute, so:

Shirts made today = 12 minutes x 6 shirts/minute
Shirts made today = 72 shirts

Therefore, the machine made 72 shirts today. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 72.

Let's assume that Luke played 'x' rounds.

According to the problem, he gained 11 points in each round.

So, the total points he gained in 'x' rounds can be calculated as 11x.

But we know that he scored 154 points in total.

So, we can write the equation as:

11x = 154

Now, we can solve for 'x' by dividing both sides by 11.

11x/11 = 154/11

x = 14

Therefore, Luke played 14 rounds of the trivia game. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

Step 1: We know that Paco had 28 cookies.
Step 2: We also know that he had 7 cookies left after eating some.
Step 3: To find out how many cookies he ate, we need to subtract the number of cookies he had left from the number he started with.
Step 4: So, we can set up an equation: 28 - x = 7, where x is the number of cookies Paco ate.
Step 5: To solve for x, we can subtract 7 from both sides: 28 - 7 - x = 7 - 7
Step 6: Simplifying, we get: 21 - x = 0
Step 7: Finally, we can solve for x by subtracting 21 from both sides: 21 - x - 21 = 0 - 21
Step 8: Simplifying, we get: -x = -21
Step 9: To isolate x, we can divide both sides by -1: -x/-1 = -21/-1
Step 10: Simplifying, we get: x = 21

Therefore, Paco ate 21 cookies. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 21.

12 + 7 = 19

So Dave used 19 tickets in total. 

Next, we need to find out how many more tickets he used to buy toys than he did to buy clothes. To do that, we can subtract the number of tickets he used to buy clothes from the number of tickets he used to buy toys:

12 - 7 = 5

Therefore, Dave used 5 more tickets to buy toys than he did to buy clothes.

Q: 2 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop some more children got on the bus. Then there were 10 children altogether on the bus. How many more children are on the bus now than there were before the bus stop?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together. 

We know that initially there were 2 children on the bus. Then, some more children got on the bus at the bus stop. Let's call the number of children who got on the bus "x". 

So, after the bus stop, there were 2 + x children on the bus. And we also know that there were 10 children altogether on the bus after the bus stop. 

Therefore, we can set up an equation: 

2 + x = 10 

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides: 

x = 8 

So, 8 more children got on the bus at the bus stop. 

To answer the original question, we can subtract the initial number of children (2) from the total number of children on the bus after the bus stop (10): 

10 - 2 = 8 

So, there are 8 more children on the bus now than there were before the bus stop. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

Q: Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework How many pages of reading homework did she have to complete?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent the problem. Let's say that the number of pages of reading homework Rachel had to complete is "r". 

According to the problem, Rachel had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework. So, the number of pages of math homework she had to complete is "r + 4". 

We also know that Rachel had to complete a total of 7 pages of math homework and reading homework combined. So, we can set up an equation: 

r + (r + 4) = 7 

Simplifying this equation: 

2r + 4 = 7 

Subtracting 4 from both sides: 

2r = 3 

Dividing both sides by 2: 

r = 1.5 

So, Rachel had to complete 1.5 pages of reading homework. However, since she can't complete half a page, we can round up to say that she had to complete 2 pages of reading homework. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2 pages of reading homework.

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes How many students suggested bacon?
A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assign variables to the unknowns in the problem. Let's call the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes "m" and the number of students who suggested bacon "b". 

From the problem, we know that:

- m + b = 182 (since a total of 182 students made suggestions)
- b = m + 166 (since 166 more students suggested bacon than mashed potatoes)

Now we can use substitution to solve for one of the variables. Let's substitute the second equation into the first equation:

m + (m + 166) = 182

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2m + 166 = 182

Subtracting 166 from both sides, we get:

2m = 16

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

m = 8

Now that we know that 8 students suggested mashed potatoes, we can use the second equation to find the number of students who suggested bacon:

b = m + 166 = 8 + 166 = 174

Therefore, 174 students suggested adding bacon to the menu. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 174.

First, we need to find out how many items Jerry had on the shelf in total. We can do this by adding the number of books and action figures:

7 books + 3 action figures = 10 items

So, Jerry had 10 items on the shelf.

Next, we need to find out how many action figures Jerry had after he added 2 more. We can do this by adding the original number of action figures to the number he added:

3 action figures + 2 more = 5 action figures

So, Jerry had 5 action figures on the shelf after he added 2 more.

Finally, we need to find out how many more books than action figures Jerry had on the shelf. We can do this by subtracting the number of action figures from the total number of items:

10 items - 5 action figures = 5 books

Therefore, Jerry had 5 more books than action figures on his shelf.

Q: Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

First, we need to find out how much Jessie weighs after the two weeks of jogging. We can do this by subtracting the weight she lost from her starting weight:

9 kg - 62 kg - 140 kg = -193 kg

Uh oh, it looks like we have a problem. The result is negative, which doesn't make sense for a weight measurement. This means that there must be an error in the problem statement. 

Perhaps the weight loss values were meant to be smaller, such as 6.2 kg and 14 kg, respectively. In that case, we can redo the calculation:

9 kg - 6.2 kg - 14 kg = -11.2 kg

Again, we have a negative result, which means there is still an error. It's possible that the weight loss values were accidentally swapped, so let's try that:

9 kg + 62 kg + 140 kg = 211 kg

This result makes more sense - it means that Jessie weighed 211 kg before starting to jog.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Write down the given information.
- Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds.
- Together, their strawberries weighed 47 pounds.

Step 2: Find the weight of his dad's strawberries.
- To find the weight of his dad's strawberries, we can subtract Marco's strawberries' weight from the total weight of their strawberries.
- Dad's strawberries = Total weight - Marco's strawberries
- Dad's strawberries = 47 - 30
- Dad's strawberries = 17 pounds

Step 3: Find the difference in weight between Marco's and his dad's strawberries.
- To find the difference in weight, we can subtract his dad's strawberries' weight from Marco's strawberries' weight.
- Difference in weight = Marco's strawberries - Dad's strawberries
- Difference in weight = 30 - 17
- Difference in weight = 13 pounds

Step 4: Answer the question.
- Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds more than his dad's strawberries. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 13 pounds.

Q: Lewis earns $ 368 every week during the 1359 weeks of harvest. If he has to pay $ 388 rent every week How much money does he pay as rent during the harvest season?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Lewis earns during the entire harvest season. To do this, we can multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the harvest season:

$368/week x 1359 weeks = $499,512

So Lewis earns a total of $499,512 during the harvest season.

Next, we need to find out how much he pays in rent each week. According to the problem, he pays $388 in rent every week.

Finally, we can calculate how much he pays in rent during the harvest season by multiplying his weekly rent by the number of weeks in the harvest season:

$388/week x 1359 weeks = $527,292

Therefore, Lewis pays a total of $527,292 in rent during the harvest season.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cups of flour Mary still needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already put in from the total amount of flour the recipe calls for:

9 cups of flour - 4 cups of flour = 5 cups of flour

So Mary still needs to add 5 cups of flour.

Next, we need to find out how many cups of sugar she needs to add. Since the recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and she hasn't added any yet, she needs to add the full amount:

11 cups of sugar

Finally, we need to find the difference between the amount of sugar and the amount of flour she needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount of flour she needs to add from the amount of sugar she needs to add:

11 cups of sugar - 5 cups of flour = 6 cups of sugar

So Mary needs to add 6 more cups of sugar than cups of flour.

Total cups of sugar = 11 
Total cups of flour = 6 + 12 (since Mary already put in 12 cups) = 18 
Total cups of salt = 9 

Next, we need to find the difference between the cups of sugar and salt. 

Difference = Total cups of sugar - Total cups of salt 
Difference = 11 - 9

Q: Debby bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a day How many days would the soda bottles last?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many soda bottles Debby has left after buying them on sale. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of soda bottles she drank from the total number of soda bottles she bought: 

360 soda bottles - 9 soda bottles/day x number of days = remaining soda bottles 

Next, we need to figure out how many days the remaining soda bottles will last. 

To do this, we can divide the remaining soda bottles by the number of soda bottles Debby drinks per day: 

remaining soda bottles รท 9 soda bottles/day = number of days 

Putting it all together: 

360 soda bottles - 9 soda bottles/day x number of days = remaining soda bottles 

remaining soda bottles รท 9 soda bottles/day = number of days 

We don't know the number of days yet, so let's solve for it. 

360 - 9x = remaining soda bottles 

remaining soda bottles รท 9 = x 

Now we can substitute the value of remaining soda bottles into the second equation: 

(360 - 9x) รท 9 = x 

Simplifying: 

40 - x = x 

2x = 40 

x = 20 

Therefore, the soda bottles 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 20 days.

If there were 600 visitors the previous day How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many visitors per painting there were on that day. We can do this by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of paintings:

661 visitors / 39 paintings = 16.95 visitors per painting

Next, we need to find out how many visitors there were per painting on the previous day. We can do this by dividing the total number of visitors on the previous day by the number of paintings:

600 visitors / 39 paintings = 15.38 visitors per painting

Finally, we can find out how many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day by subtracting the number of visitors per painting on the previous day from the number of visitors per painting on that day:

16.95 visitors per painting - 15.38 visitors per painting = 1.57 more visitors per painting

So, on that day, there were 1.57 more visitors per painting than on the previous day. To find out how many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day, we can multiply this difference by the number of paintings:

1.57 more visitors per painting * 39 paintings = 61.23 more visitors

Therefore, there were 61.23 more

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds. Let's call his dad's strawberries "x" pounds.

Together, their strawberries weighed 26 pounds. So we can set up an equation:

10 + x = 26

Now we can solve for x:

x = 26 - 10

x = 16

So Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 16 pounds.

To answer the question, we need to find the difference between Marco's strawberries (10 pounds) and his dad's strawberries (16 pounds):

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. 

Let's call the number of cups of flour Mary has already put in "x". 

We also know that Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. So, we can set up an equation: 

x + 5 = 3 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

x = -2 

This doesn't make sense because we can't have a negative number of cups of flour. 

So, let's try setting up the equation a different way: 

10 - x = 3 + 5 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

7 = x + 5 

Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get: 

2 = x 

Therefore, Mary has already put in 2 cups of flour. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

Q: 6 red peaches, 90 yellow peaches and 16 green peaches are in the basket. How many red and green peaches are in the basket?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we know that there are 6 red peaches and 16 green peaches in the basket. 

Next, we need to figure out how many peaches there are in total. To do this, we can add up the number of each color: 

6 red + 90 yellow + 16 green = 112 peaches 

So there are 112 peaches in total. 

Finally, we can subtract the number of yellow peaches from the total to find out how many red and green peaches there are: 

112 total - 90 yellow = 22 red and green peaches 

Therefore, there are 6 red peaches and 16 green peaches in the basket. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6 red peaches and 16 green peaches.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Zachary did 51 push-ups. 

Next, we know that David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary. So we can add 22 to 51 to get:

51 + 22 = 73

Therefore, David did 73 push-ups.

Finally, we know that John did 4 push-ups less than David. So we can subtract 4 from 73 to get:

73 - 4 = 69

Therefore, John did 69 push-ups. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 69.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps. He found 30 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 63 old ones. Now he has 42 bottle caps in his collection. How many more bottle caps did danny throw away than those he found at the park?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found the 30 at the park. We can do this by subtracting the 30 from his current collection of 42:

42 - 30 = 12

So Danny had 12 bottle caps before he found the 30 at the park.

Next, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny threw away. We can do this by subtracting his current collection of 42 from the total number of bottle caps he had before he found the 30 at the park:

(30 + 12) - 42 = 0

This means that Danny threw away the same number of bottle caps that he found at the park, which is:

30 - 0 = 30

Therefore, Danny threw away 30 more bottle caps than he found at the park. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 30.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Dan has $3. He then spends $4 on two candy bars. We want to find out how much each candy bar costs. 

To do this, we can start by subtracting the amount Dan spent on candy bars from the amount he had originally: 

$3 - $4 = -$1 

This means that Dan now has -$1, or he owes $1. 

Since we know that each candy bar costs the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the number of candy bars: 

$4 รท 2 = $2 

Therefore, each candy bar costs $2. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $2.

First, we need to find out how many items Jerry had on his shelf in total before adding the 4 books. We can do this by adding the number of action figures and books he had:

7 action figures + 2 books = 9 items

Next, we need to find out how many books Jerry had on his shelf after adding the 4 more books:

2 books + 4 books = 6 books

Finally, we need to find out how many more action figures than books Jerry had on his shelf:

7 action figures - 6 books = 1 more action figure than book

Therefore, Jerry had 1 more action figure than book on his shelf. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

We know that they harvest 5 sacks of ripe oranges and 74 sacks of unripe oranges per day. 

To find out how many more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges are harvested per day, we need to subtract the number of ripe oranges from the number of unripe oranges. 

So, the calculation would be:

74 (unripe oranges) - 5 (ripe oranges) = 69

Therefore, 69 more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges are harvested per day.

Ryan spends 6 hours on learning English every day. 

Next, we need to find out how many hours Ryan spends on learning English in two days. 

To do this, we can multiply the number of hours Ryan spends on learning English in one day by the number of days he learns:

We know that initially there were 3 birds and 4 storks sitting on the fence. 

Then, 6 more storks came to join them. 

So, we need to add the number of storks and birds separately. 

The number of storks initially was 4, and 6 more joined, so the total number of storks is 4 + 6 = 10. 

Similarly, the number of birds initially was 3, and no more birds joined, so the total number of birds is still 3. 

Therefore, the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence is 10 + 3 = 13.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bird families are left near the mountain after some of them flew away. We can do this by subtracting the number of families that flew away from the original number of families:

38 - 47 - 94 = -103

Uh oh, we got a negative number! This means that there are no bird families left near the mountain. We might have made a mistake somewhere. 

Let's try a different approach. We want to find the difference between the number of bird families that flew away to Asia and the number that flew away to Africa. We can do this by subtracting the number of families that flew to Africa from the number that flew to Asia:

94 - 47 = 47

So, 47 more bird families flew away to Asia than those that flew away to Africa.

Next, we need to find the number of pieces of candy in each bag. We know that there are 33 pieces of candy in each bag.

To find the total number of pieces of candy, we can multiply the number of bags by the number of pieces of candy in each bag. So:

Total number of pieces of candy = 26 x 33

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Total number of pieces of candy = 858

Therefore, Frank had 858 pieces of candy.

Total number of books = 19 
Number of books already read = 4 
Number of books left to read = 19 - 4 = 15 

Total number of movies = 62 
Number of movies already watched = 34 
Number of movies left to watch = 62 - 34 = 28

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. We can do this by subtracting the number of cards she has left from the original total:

438 baseball cards + 18 Ace cards = 456 total cards
456 total cards - 55 Ace cards - 178 baseball cards left = 223 cards given to Jeff

Now we can find out how many baseball cards and Ace cards Nell had before giving any to Jeff:

438 baseball cards + 18 Ace cards = 456 total cards

Next, we can subtract the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff from the original total to find out how many cards she has now:

456 total cards - 223 cards given to Jeff = 233 cards left

Finally, we can subtract the number of Ace cards Nell has now from the number of baseball cards she has now to find out how many more baseball cards she has:

233 cards left - 55 Ace cards = 178 baseball cards

So Nell has 178 more baseball cards than Ace cards.

First, we need to find the total number of seeds planted in one flower bed. We know that they put 10 seeds in each flower bed. 

So, 

Number of seeds in one flower bed = 10 

Next, we need to find the total number of flower beds. We know that there are 45 flower beds. 

So,

Now, we can find the total number of seeds planted by multiplying the number of seeds in one flower bed by the number of flower beds. 

Total number of seeds planted = Number of seeds in one flower bed x Number of flower beds 

Total number of seeds planted = 10 x 45 

Total number of seeds planted = 450 

Therefore, Paige and her mom planted 450 seeds in total.

38 sacks/day

Next, we need to find out how many oranges are in one sack. We know that each sack contains 42 oranges, so:

Now, we can use these two pieces of information to find out how many oranges are harvested in one day:

38 sacks/day x 42 oranges/sack = 1596 oranges/day

Finally, we can use this information to find out how many sacks of oranges they will have after 49 days of harvest:

1596 oranges/day x 49 days = 78156 oranges

To find out how many sacks this is, we need to divide by the number of oranges in one sack:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many children got off the bus. We know that there were 28 children on the bus before the stop, and 82 got on, so there were 28 + 82 = 110 children on the bus at the stop.

Next, we subtract the number of children on the bus after the stop (30) from the number of children on the bus at the stop (110) to find out how many got off: 110 - 30 = 80.

Therefore, 80 children got off the bus.

Finally, we subtract the number of children who got off the bus (80) from the number of children who got on the bus (82) to find out how many more got on than got off: 82 - 80 = 2.

Therefore, 2 more children got on the bus than got off.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many roses Jessica had after she threw away 34 roses. 

21 - 34 = -13 

This means that Jessica had -13 roses in the vase, which doesn't make sense. So we know that she must have cut some new roses from her garden to add to the vase. 

Let's call the number of new roses she cut "x". 

So after she cut x new roses, the total number of roses in the vase would be: 

21 - 34 + x = x - 13 

We know that the final number of roses in the vase is 15, so we can set up an equation: 

x - 13 = 15 

Solving for x: 

x = 28 

So Jessica cut 28 new roses from her garden. 

To find out how many more roses she threw away than those she cut from her garden, we can subtract: 

34 - 28 = 6 

Therefore, Jessica threw away 6 more roses than those she cut from her garden. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 115 dollars off each jersey and $ 25 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys. How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling jerseys and t-shirts. 

Revenue from jerseys = 78 x $115 = $8,970 
Revenue from t-shirts = 113 x $25 = $2,825 

Next, we can find the difference in revenue between the two: 

$8,970 - $2,825 = $6,145 

This means that the Razorback shop made $6,145 more from selling jerseys than from selling t-shirts. 

To find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt on average, we can divide this difference by the number of jerseys sold: 

$6,145 / 78 = $78.85 

Therefore, on average, a jersey costs $78.85 more than a t-shirt. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $78.85.

Q: Each pack of dvds costs 76 dollars. If there is a discount of 25 dollars on each pack How much do you have to pay to buy each pack?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the new price of each pack after the discount. To do this, we subtract the discount of 25 dollars from the original price of 76 dollars:

76 - 25 = 51

So the new price of each pack is 51 dollars. Therefore, if you want to buy one pack, you would have to pay 51 dollars. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 51 dollars.

Q: Every day Ryan spends 7 hours on learning english and some more hours on learning chinese. If he spends 2 hours more on learning english than on learning chinese How many hours does he spend on learning chinese?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ryan spends 7 hours on learning English. 

Let's call the number of hours he spends on learning Chinese "x". 

We also know that he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

7 = x + 2 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtract 2 from both sides: 

7 - 2 = x 

Simplify: 

5 = x 

Therefore, Ryan spends 5 hours on learning Chinese. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

Q: Baker made 52 pastries and 84 cakes. If he sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries How many more cakes than pastries did baker make?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pastries and cakes Baker has left after selling some of them. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of pastries and cakes sold from the original number of pastries and cakes made: 

Pastries left = 52 - 94 = -42 
Cakes left = 84 - 102 = -18 

Uh oh, it looks like we have negative numbers! This means that Baker sold more pastries and cakes than he actually made. 

So, we can't answer the question of how many more cakes than pastries Baker made. We would need to have accurate information about how many pastries and cakes Baker actually made and sold.

Q: Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost 20 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 17 marbles How many marbles does Doug have now?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Ed had before he lost 20. We know that Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug, and we also know that Ed had 17 marbles after losing 20. So, we can set up an equation:

Ed's marbles before losing 20 = Doug's marbles + 12

Ed's marbles before losing 20 - 20 = 17

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

Doug's marbles + 12 - 20 = 17

Simplifying, we get:

Doug's marbles - 8 = 17

Adding 8 to both sides, we get:

Doug's marbles = 25

Therefore, Doug has 25 marbles now. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 25.

First, we need to find the total number of emails Jack received in the morning and afternoon. To do this, we can add the number of emails he received in the morning and the number of emails he received in the afternoon. 

So, 

Total number of emails in the morning and afternoon = Number of emails in the morning + Number of emails in the afternoon 

= 5 + 8

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of bird families near the mountain before any migration or arrival. We know that there are 49 bird families living near the mountain.

Next, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away for winter. We know that 59 bird families flew away, so we can subtract 59 from 49:

49 - 59 = -10

Uh oh, we got a negative number! This means that there are actually 10 fewer bird families near the mountain after the migration. So we need to add the number of new bird families that arrived from the arctic to get the total number of bird families near the mountain now.

We know that 24 new bird families arrived, so we can add 24 to -10:

-10 + 24 = 14

So there are 14 bird families left near the mountain after the migration and arrival. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. We can do this by subtracting the number of cards she has left from the original total:

239 baseball cards + 38 Ace cards = 277 total cards
277 total cards - (376 Ace cards + 111 baseball cards) = 277 total cards - 487 cards left =  -210 cards given to Jeff

Since we can't have negative cards, this means that Nell made a mistake somewhere. Let's check the numbers again:

376 Ace cards + 111 baseball cards = 487 cards left
487 cards left + 210 cards given to Jeff = 697 total cards

So Nell started with 697 cards. Now we can find out how many more Ace cards she has than baseball cards:

376 Ace cards - 111 baseball cards = 265 more Ace cards than baseball cards

Therefore, Nell has 265 more Ace cards than baseball cards.

First, we need to figure out how many cups of sugar Mary still needs to add. We know the recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar, and she has already added 4 cups. So she still needs to add:

6 - 4 = 2 cups of sugar

Next, we need to figure out how many cups of flour she needs to add. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour, and she hasn't added any yet. So she needs to add:

9 - 0 = 9 cups of flour

Finally, we need to figure out the difference between the cups of flour and the cups of sugar. To do this, we subtract the cups of sugar from the cups of flour:

9 - 2 = 7

So Mary needs to add 7 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.

Next, we know that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we can subtract 7 from 17 to find out how many peaches Jake has: 

17 - 7 = 10 

Therefore, Jake has 10 peaches. 

Finally, we know that Jake has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, we can subtract 8 from Jake's number of peaches to find out how many peaches Jill has: 

10 - 8 = 2 

Therefore, Jill has 2 peaches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

Q: Paul had 108 books. After selling some books in a garage sale and giving 35 books to his friend he had 62 books left. How many books did he sell in the garage sale?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many books Paul had before giving any away or selling any. We know that he had 108 books.

Next, we need to figure out how many books he had after giving some away to his friend. We know that he gave 35 books away, so we can subtract that from the original 108 books:

108 - 35 = 73

So Paul had 73 books left after giving 35 away to his friend.

Finally, we need to figure out how many books he sold in the garage sale. We know that he ended up with 62 books, so we can subtract that from the 73 books he had after giving some away:

73 - 62 = 11

Therefore, Paul sold 11 books in the garage sale. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 11.

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of sugar 14 cups of flour and 40 cups of salt. She already put in 4 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cups of flour Mary still needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour required by the recipe:

Total flour required - Flour already added = Flour still needed
14 cups - 4 cups = 10 cups

So Mary still needs to add 10 cups of flour.

Next, we need to find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add than cups of sugar. To do this, we can subtract the amount of sugar required by the recipe from the amount of flour Mary still needs to add:

Flour still needed - Sugar required = Difference
10 cups - 9 cups = 1 cup

Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour than cups of sugar. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches.

Next, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. We know that the frog jumped 18 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can add 18 to 25 to get:

25 + 18 = 43

So the frog jumped 43 inches.

Finally, we need to find out how far the mouse jumped. We know that the mouse jumped 2 inches farther than the frog, so we can add 2 to 43 to get:

43 + 2 = 45

So the mouse jumped 45 inches.

Therefore, the mouse jumped 45 inches in the jumping contest.

Q: There were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. How many more orchids than roses are there in the vase now?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we need to find out how many flowers Jessica added to the vase. We can do this by subtracting the original number of flowers from the current number of flowers:

Number of orchids added = 13 - 6 = 7
Number of roses added = 3 - 9 = -6

Uh oh, it looks like we have a negative number of roses added. This means that Jessica actually removed roses from the vase instead of adding them. Let's adjust our calculations accordingly:

Number of orchids added = 13 - 6 = 7
Number of roses removed = 9 - 3 = 6

Now we know that Jessica added 7 orchids and removed 6 roses. To find out how many more orchids than roses there are in the vase now, we can subtract the current number of roses from the current number of orchids:

Number of orchids now - Number of roses now = 13 - 3 = 10

So there are 10 more orchids than roses in the vase now. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 10.

77 - 172 = -95 

Uh oh, this doesn't make sense! We can't have negative potatoes. It looks like there was an error in the problem. 

Let's assume that the farmer picked 72 potatoes instead of 172. Then, we can subtract that number from the original number of potatoes: 

77 - 72 = 5 

So the farmer has 5 potatoes left. 

Now, we can subtract the number of picked potatoes from the original number of tomatoes: 

175 - 72 = 103 

So the farmer has 103 tomatoes left. 

Therefore, the farmer has 103 tomatoes and 5 potatoes left.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to figure out how many push-ups Zachary did. Let's call the number of push-ups Zachary did "x". 

According to the problem, David did 49 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can write an equation: 

51 = x + 49 

To solve for x, we can subtract 49 from both sides: 

51 - 49 = x 

2 = x 

So Zachary did 2 push-ups. 

To find out how many push-ups they did altogether, we can add David's 51 push-ups to Zachary's 2 push-ups: 

51 + 2 = 53 

So Zachary and David did 53 push-ups altogether.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money made from selling t-shirts. To do this, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold (158) by the profit made from each t-shirt ($204):

Total profit from t-shirts = 158 x $204 = $32,232

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money made from selling jerseys. We know that they sold 2 jerseys and made $76 off each one:

Total profit from jerseys = 2 x $76 = $152

Therefore, the Razorback shop made $152 from selling the jerseys during the game.

To do this, we can add the number of yellow peaches and the number of green peaches: 

14 yellow peaches + 6 green peaches = 20 

So there are 20 green and yellow peaches in the basket. 

Next, we need to find out how many of those 20 peaches are green. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches: 

20 total peaches - 5 red peaches = 15 

So there are 15 green and yellow peaches in the basket, and 6 of them are green. 

Therefore, there are 14 yellow peaches and 6 green peaches in the basket.

Dan had $4 at the start and spent $3 on a candy bar. So, we can subtract $3 from $4 to find out how much money he had left after buying the candy bar.

$4 - $3 = $1

Therefore, Dan had $1 left after buying the candy bar. 

Now, we can use this information to find out how much the candy bar cost. We know that Dan had $1 left after buying the candy bar, so we can set up an equation:

Cost of candy bar + $1 = $4

We can solve for the cost of the candy bar by subtracting $1 from both sides of the equation:

Cost of candy bar = $4 - $1

Cost of candy bar = $3

Therefore, the candy bar cost $3. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $3.

frog's jump distance + 4 inches = 35 inches

If we subtract 4 inches from both sides of the equation, we get:

frog's jump distance = 31 inches

Now that we know the frog's jump distance, we can add it to the grasshopper's jump distance to find the total distance they jumped:

35 inches (grasshopper's jump distance) + 31 inches (frog's jump distance) = 66 inches

So, they jumped a total of 66 inches altogether.

Q: Jerry had some action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 2 more action figures to the shelf and removed 7 of the old ones. If there are 10 action figures on his shelf now How many action figures did he have initially on the shelf?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Jerry added 2 more action figures to the shelf. So, if he had x action figures initially, he now has x + 2 action figures on the shelf.

Next, we know that he removed 7 of the old ones. So, he now has x + 2 - 7 = x - 5 action figures on the shelf.

Finally, we know that there are 10 action figures on the shelf now. So, we can set up an equation:

x - 5 + 10 = x + 2

Q: Kelly has 106 nintendo games. How many will she have left if she gives away 64 games?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to subtract the number of games Kelly gives away from the total number of games she has: 

106 - 64 = 42 

So Kelly will have 42 Nintendo games left after giving away 64. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 42.

Q: Dan has $ 4. He bought a candy bar for $ 8. Then his friend have him $ 5 How much money is left?
A: Let's think step by step. First, Dan had $4. Then he bought a candy bar for $8, which means he spent $8 from his $4. So, he now has -$4 (negative four dollars).

Next, his friend gave him $5. Adding $5 to -$4, we get $1.

Therefore, Dan has $1 left after buying a candy bar and receiving $5 from his friend. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: Bryan took a look at his books and magazines. If he has 9 books and 46 magazines in each of his 10 bookshelves How many magazines does he have in total?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many magazines Bryan has in one bookshelf. To do this, we can multiply the number of magazines in each bookshelf (46) by the number of books in each bookshelf (9):

46 x 9 = 414

So, Bryan has 414 magazines in each bookshelf. 

Next, we need to find out how many magazines he has in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of magazines in each bookshelf (414) by the number of bookshelves (10):

414 x 10 = 4,140

Therefore, Bryan has a total of 4,140 magazines. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4,140.

Q: Jesse's room is 7 feet long. If she needs a carpet of size 14 square feet What is the width of her room?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that the area of Jesse's room is 14 square feet and the length of the room is 7 feet. To find the width of the room, we can use the formula:

Area = Length x Width

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width:

Width = Area / Length

Substituting the given values, we get:

Width = 14 sq. ft / 7 ft

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Width = 2 ft

Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 2 feet. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

Q: Baker made 54 cakes and 143 pastries. If he sold 68 cakes and 92 pastries How many more pastries than cakes did baker sell?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cakes and pastries Baker has left after selling 68 cakes and 92 pastries. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of cakes and pastries sold from the original number of cakes and pastries: 

54 cakes - 68 cakes = -14 cakes (negative means he sold more cakes than he had) 

143 pastries - 92 pastries = 51 pastries 

So, Baker has 14 fewer cakes and 51 pastries left. 

Next, we need to find out how many more pastries than cakes Baker sold. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of pastries sold: 

92 pastries - 68 cakes = 24 

Therefore, Baker sold 24 more pastries than cakes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 24.

Q: Baker made 99 cakes. He bought 167 new cakes and sold 89 cakes. How many more cakes did baker buy than those he sold?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Baker made 99 cakes.
He bought 167 new cakes.
He sold 89 cakes.

To find out how many more cakes Baker bought than those he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the number of cakes he bought.

So, the calculation would be:

167 (number of cakes bought) - 89 (number of cakes sold) = 78

Therefore, Baker bought 78 more cakes than those he sold. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 78.

Q: They decided to hold the party in their backyard. They have 2 sets of tables, each having the same number of chairs. If there are a total of 12 chairs in the backyard How many chairs are there for each table?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 2 sets of tables, and each set has the same number of chairs. Let's call the number of chairs in each set "x". 

So, the total number of chairs in the backyard is 2x. We also know that the total number of chairs is 12. 

Therefore, we can set up an equation: 

2x = 12 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2: 

x = 6 

So there are 6 chairs for each table. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

Q: Last week Fred had 60 dollars and Jason had 19 dollars. Jason washed cars over the weekend and now has 33 dollars. How much money did Jason make washing cars?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

Step 1: Find the difference between Fred's and Jason's money last week.
- Fred had 60 dollars
- Jason had 19 dollars
- Difference = 60 - 19 = 41 dollars

Step 2: Add the difference to Jason's current money to find out how much he has now.
- Jason had 33 dollars after washing cars
- Add the difference from step 1: 33 + 41 = 74 dollars

Step 3: Subtract Jason's initial money from his current money to find out how much he made washing cars.
- Jason had 19 dollars initially
- Subtract from his current money: 74 - 19 = 55 dollars

Therefore, Jason made 55 dollars washing cars over the weekend. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 55.

Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 71 sacks of unripe oranges and 60 sacks of ripe oranges per day. How many more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges are harvested per day?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together. 

We know that they harvest 71 sacks of unripe oranges and 60 sacks of ripe oranges per day. 

To find out how many more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges are harvested per day, we need to subtract the number of ripe oranges from the number of unripe oranges. 

So, the calculation would be: 

71 sacks of unripe oranges - 60 sacks of ripe oranges = 11 more sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day. 

Therefore, they harvest 11 more sacks of unripe oranges than ripe oranges per day. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 11.

Q: Tiffany was collecting cans for recycling. On monday she had 8 bags of cans. The next day she found 7 more bags worth of cans. How many more bags did she have on monday than she found on the next day?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bags of cans Tiffany had in total after finding 7 more bags on the next day. 

To do this, we can add the number of bags she had on Monday (8) to the number of bags she found the next day (7): 

8 + 7 = 15 

So Tiffany had 15 bags of cans in total. 

Next, we need to find out how many more bags she had on Monday than she found on the next day. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of bags she found the next day (7) from the number of bags she had on Monday (8): 

8 - 7 = 1 

Therefore, Tiffany had 1 more bag of cans on Monday than she found on the next day. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: Paco had 25 cookies. He ate 5 of them. Then he bought 3 more cookies How many more cookies did he eat than those he bought?
A: Let's think step by step. Step 1: Paco had 25 cookies.
Step 2: He ate 5 of them. So, he had 25 - 5 = 20 cookies left.
Step 3: He bought 3 more cookies. So, he had 20 + 3 = 23 cookies.
Step 4: He ate 5 cookies and bought 3 more. So, he ate 5 - 3 = 2 more cookies than he bought. 

Therefore, Paco ate 2 more cookies than he bought. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

Q: Baker made 157 cakes and 169 pastries. If he sold 158 cakes and 147 pastries How many more cakes than pastries did baker sell?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cakes and pastries Baker has left after selling some of them. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of cakes and pastries sold from the original number of cakes and pastries Baker made: 

Number of cakes left = 157 - 158 = -1 
Number of pastries left = 169 - 147 = 22 

Uh oh, it looks like Baker sold more cakes than he made! Let's assume that there was a mistake in the problem and Baker actually made 158 cakes instead of 157. 

Number of cakes left = 158 - 158 = 0 
Number of pastries left = 169 - 147 = 22 

Now we can find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker sold by subtracting the number of pastries sold from the number of cakes sold: 

Number of cakes sold - Number of pastries sold = 158 - 147 = 11 

Therefore, Baker sold 11 more cakes than pastries. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 11.

Q: Faye was placing 12 pencils equally into 3 rows. How many pencils did she place in each row?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many pencils Faye placed in total. We know she placed 12 pencils. 

Next, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of rows. In this case, Faye placed the pencils in 3 rows. 

So, to find out how many pencils she placed in each row, we can divide 12 by 3: 

12 รท 3 = 4 

Therefore, Faye placed 4 pencils in each row. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

Q: Adam could fit 8 action figures and 10 cabinets on each shelf in his room. His room has 4 shelves. How many total items could his shelves hold?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of items that can fit on one shelf. To do this, we can add the number of action figures and cabinets that can fit on one shelf:

8 + 10 = 18

So, one shelf can hold 18 items.

Next, we need to find the total number of items that can fit on all four shelves. To do this, we can multiply the number of items that can fit on one shelf by the number of shelves:

18 x 4 = 72

Therefore, the shelves in Adam's room can hold a total of 72 items. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 72.

Q: Bobby ate 38 pieces of candy. Then he ate 36 more. He also ate 16 pieces of chocolate. How many more pieces of candy than chocolate did Bobby eat?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many pieces of candy Bobby ate in total. We can do this by adding the initial amount of candy he ate (38) to the additional amount he ate (36): 

38 + 36 = 74 

So Bobby ate 74 pieces of candy in total. 

Next, we need to find out how many more pieces of candy he ate than chocolate. We can do this by subtracting the number of pieces of chocolate he ate (16) from the total number of pieces of candy he ate: 

74 - 16 = 58 

Therefore, Bobby ate 58 more pieces of candy than chocolate. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 58.

Q: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines after 57 stops. He was told by 252 of the pickers that they fill 108 drums of grapes per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we know that after 57 stops, the person checked on the grapevines. This information doesn't seem relevant to the problem, so we can ignore it for now.

Next, we are told that 252 pickers fill 108 drums of grapes per day. So, we can calculate the total number of drums filled in one day by multiplying the number of pickers by the number of drums filled by each picker:

252 pickers x 108 drums/picker = 27,216 drums/day

Now, we need to find out how many drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days. To do this, we can simply multiply the number of drums filled in one day by the number of days:

27,216 drums/day x 58 days = 1,577,728 drums

Therefore, 1,577,728 drums of grapes would be filled in 58 days. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1,577,728.

Q: Edward spent $ 6 to buy 2 books each book costing him the same amount of money. Now he has $ 12. How much did each book cost?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent the problem. Let x be the cost of each book. 

According to the problem, Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books, so we can write: 

2x = 6 

Solving for x: 

x = 3 

So each book costs $3. 

Now, we are told that Edward has $12. We can use this information to check our answer. 

If each book costs $3, then Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books. He now has $12, which means he has $6 more than he started with. 

Since he bought 2 books, he must have sold them for a total of $6 + $6 = $12. 

Therefore, our answer is correct. Each book costs $3. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: If each pack costs 81 dollars How much will it cost to buy 33 packs of dvds?
A: Let's think step by step. To find the total cost of 33 packs of DVDs, we need to multiply the cost of one pack by the number of packs we want to buy. 

So, if each pack costs 81 dollars, then the total cost of 33 packs of DVDs would be:

81 x 33 = 2673 dollars

Therefore, it would cost 2673 dollars to buy 33 packs of DVDs. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2673.

Q: After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height. Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron. If Ron stands at 13 feet How deep was the water?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find Dean's height. We know that Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, who is 13 feet tall. So, Dean's height is:

Dean's height = Ron's height + 4 feet
Dean's height = 13 feet + 4 feet
Dean's height = 17 feet

Now, we know that the depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height. So, we can calculate the depth of the water as:

Depth of water = 15 times Dean's height
Depth of water = 15 times 17 feet
Depth of water = 255 feet

Therefore, the depth of the water is 255 feet. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 255.

Q: Bobby ate 28 pieces of candy. Then he ate 42 more. He also ate 63 pieces of chocolate. How many pieces of candy did Bobby eat?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Bobby ate 28 pieces of candy. Then he ate 42 more. So, we can add these two numbers to find out how many pieces of candy he ate in total: 

28 + 42 = 70 

Next, we know that he also ate 63 pieces of chocolate. However, the question specifically asks for how many pieces of candy he ate. So, we can subtract the number of chocolate pieces from the total number of pieces he ate: 

70 - 63 = 7 

Therefore, Bobby ate 7 pieces of candy. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

Q: Zachary did 51 push-ups and David did 44 push-ups in gym class today. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than David?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find the difference between the number of push-ups done by Zachary and David. To do that, we can subtract the number of push-ups done by David from the number of push-ups done by Zachary.

So, the difference between the number of push-ups done by Zachary and David is:

51 - 44 = 7

Therefore, Zachary did 7 more push-ups than David. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

Q: 3 red peaches, and some more green peaches are in the basket. If there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches in the basket How many green peaches are in the basket?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that there are 3 red peaches in the basket. 

Next, we know that there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches. So, we can set up an equation: 

green peaches = red peaches + 10 

We can substitute in the value we know for red peaches: 

green peaches = 3 + 10 

green peaches = 13 

Therefore, there are 13 green peaches in the basket. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 13.

Q: Dave had 11 apps and 3 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files he had 24 files and 2 apps left. How many more files than apps does he have left on the phone?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Dave had 11 apps and 3 files on his phone.

Let's represent the number of apps as "a" and the number of files as "f".

So, a = 11 and f = 3.

After deleting some apps and files he had 24 files and 2 apps left.

Let's represent the new number of apps as "x" and the new number of files as "y".

So, x = 2 and y = 24.

We need to find out how many more files than apps Dave has left on the phone.

To do that, we can subtract the number of apps from the number of files.

So, y - x = 24 - 2 = 22.

Therefore, Dave has 22 more files than apps left on the phone. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 22.

Q: For Gwen's birthday she received 7 dollars. She spent some money and has 5 dollars left with her. How much money did she spend?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

We know that Gwen received 7 dollars for her birthday. 

We also know that she has 5 dollars left with her. 

So, to find out how much money she spent, we can subtract the amount she has left from the amount she received: 

7 - 5 = 2 

Therefore, Gwen spent 2 dollars.

Q: David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups How many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many push-ups Zachary did. We know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, and we also know that David did 38 push-ups. So we can set up an equation:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 56
38 = Zachary's push-ups + 56

Now we can solve for Zachary's push-ups:

Zachary's push-ups = 38 - 56
Zachary's push-ups = -18

Uh oh, it looks like we have a problem. A negative number of push-ups doesn't make sense! This means that there must be an error in the problem. Perhaps it was supposed to say that Zachary did 56 more push-ups than David, in which case we would set up the equation like this:

Zachary's push-ups = David's push-ups + 56
Zachary's push-ups = 38 + 56
Zachary's push-ups = 94

Now we can find the total number of push-ups:

Total push-ups = David's push-ups + Zachary's push-ups
Total push-ups = 38 + 94
Total push-ups = 132

So David and

Q: Baker made 7 cakes and 148 pastries. If he sold 15 cakes and 103 pastries How many pastries would baker still have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cakes and pastries Baker has left after selling 15 cakes and 103 pastries. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of cakes and pastries sold from the original number of cakes and pastries Baker had: 

Number of cakes left = 7 - 15 = -8 

Number of pastries left = 148 - 103 = 45 

Uh oh, it looks like Baker sold more cakes than he had originally made! We can't have a negative number of cakes left, so we'll assume that Baker actually made 15 cakes instead of 7. 

So, let's try again: 

Number of cakes left = 15 - 15 = 0 

Number of pastries left = 148 - 103 = 45 

Therefore, Baker would have 45 pastries left after selling 15 cakes and 103 pastries. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45.

Q: Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework, 2 pages of reading homework and 96 more pages of biology homework. How many more pages of math homework than reading homework did she have?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Rachel had to complete:
- 9 pages of math homework
- 2 pages of reading homework
- 96 more pages of biology homework

To find out how many more pages of math homework Rachel had than reading homework, we need to subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the number of pages of math homework.

So, the calculation would be:

9 pages of math homework - 2 pages of reading homework = 7 pages more of math homework than reading homework

Therefore, Rachel had 7 more pages of math homework than reading homework.

Q: In a school there are 732 girls and 761 boys. 682 more girls and 8 more boys joined the school. How many girls are there in the school now?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of girls and boys in the school before the new students joined. 

Total number of girls = 732 
Total number of boys = 761 

Next, we need to add the number of new students who joined the school. 

New girls = 682 
New boys = 8 

Now, we can add the new students to the existing number of students to find the new total. 

Total number of girls = 732 + 682 = 1414 
Total number of boys = 761 + 8 = 769 

Therefore, there are 1414 girls in the school now.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that they put 10 seeds in each flower bed. Let's call the number of flower beds "x". 

So, the total number of seeds they planted can be expressed as 10x. 

We also know that they planted 60 seeds altogether. So we can set up an equation: 

10x = 60 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 10: 

x = 6 

Therefore, they had 6 flower beds in total.

Q: David did 36 more push-ups but 33 less crunches than Zachary in gym class today. If Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches How many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. We know that David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 36 to Zachary's number of push-ups:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 36
David's push-ups = 58 + 36
David's push-ups = 94

Next, we need to find out how many crunches David did. We know that David did 33 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 33 from Zachary's number of crunches:

David's crunches = Zachary's crunches - 33
David's crunches = 33 - 33
David's crunches = 0

Now we can calculate how many more push-ups than crunches Zachary did:

Zachary's push-ups - Zachary's crunches = 58 - 33
Zachary's push-ups - Zachary's crunches = 25

Therefore, Zachary did 25 more push-ups than crunches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 25.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Edward spent $17. So, before he spent his money, he had:

$17 (money he spent) + $7 (money he has now) + $10 (money he received from his friend) = $34

Therefore, Edward had $34 before he spent his money.

Q: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 84 classrooms. 95 school buses are fully filled with 118 seats on each school bus. How many students are in the school?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many seats are available in all the school buses combined. We can do this by multiplying the number of buses by the number of seats on each bus:

95 buses x 118 seats/bus = 11,210 total seats

Next, we need to figure out how many students can fit in all the classrooms combined. We don't know how many students are in each classroom, so we'll have to make an assumption. Let's say that each classroom has an average of 25 students (this is just an estimate, but it should be close enough for our purposes).

84 classrooms x 25 students/classroom = 2,100 total students

Finally, we can add up the number of students on the field trip (assuming every seat on every bus is filled and every classroom has an average of 25 students):

11,210 seats + 2,100 students = 13,310 total students on the field trip. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 13,310.

Q: Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 6. Rebecca has 18 eggs 72 bananas and 66 marbles. How many groups will be created?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many groups of 6 eggs can be made from the total number of eggs. 

To do this, we can divide the total number of eggs by 6: 

18 รท 6 = 3 

So, there are 3 groups of 6 eggs that can be made from the total number of eggs. 

Next, we need to determine if there are any remaining items that cannot be grouped into sets of 6. 

We have 72 bananas and 66 marbles, which cannot be grouped into sets of 6. 

Therefore, the answer is that 3 groups of 6 eggs can be created, but there will be 72 bananas and 66 marbles left over. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many movies are left to watch. To do that, we need to subtract the number of movies already watched from the total number of movies in the series. 

Total number of movies in the series = 17
Number of movies already watched = 7

So, the number of movies left to watch = 17 - 7 = 10

Therefore, you still have to watch 10 more movies in the 'crazy silly school' series.

Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 41 sacks of unripe oranges and 86 sacks of ripe oranges per day. How many more sacks of ripe oranges than unripe oranges are harvested per day?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we need to find out how many more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested per day than unripe oranges. To do this, we need to subtract the number of unripe oranges from the number of ripe oranges.

So, the calculation would be:

86 sacks of ripe oranges - 41 sacks of unripe oranges = ?

Next, we can simplify the calculation by subtracting the ones place first, then the tens place:

6 - 1 = 5
8 - 4 = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

86 sacks of ripe oranges - 41 sacks of unripe oranges = 45 sacks of ripe oranges

So, 45 more sacks of ripe oranges are harvested per day than unripe oranges. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45.

Next, we need to figure out how many kids she played with on Tuesday. We know that the total number of kids she played with on both days is 15. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

5 + x = 15 

Here, x represents the number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday. 

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides: 

x = 10 

Therefore, Julia played with 10 kids on Tuesday.

Q: Paul got a box of 457 erasers and 617 crayons for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 523 crayons left while not having lost a single eraser. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crayons Paul had at the end of the school year. We know he started with 617 crayons and ended with 523, so we can subtract:

617 - 523 = 94

So Paul used 94 crayons during the school year.

Next, we need to find out how many erasers he had left. We know he started with 457 erasers and didn't lose any, so he still has:

457 erasers

Now we can compare the number of crayons he had left to the number of erasers he had left:

94 crayons - 457 erasers = -363

Uh oh, we have a negative number! This means that Paul had 363 more erasers than crayons at the end of the school year.

We know that initially there were 4 birds and 46 storks sitting on the fence. So the total number of birds and storks was:

4 + 46 = 50

Then, 6 more birds came to join them. So the total number of birds on the fence now is:

4 + 6 = 10

And the total number of storks on the fence is still:

46

Therefore, the total number of birds and storks on the fence now is:

10 + 46 = 56

So, there are 56 birds and storks sitting on the fence now.

Total amount made = $325 + $114 = $439

Next, we need to find the average amount made per day in the remaining 57 days. We can do this by dividing the total amount made by the number of days:

Average amount made per day = $114 รท 57 = $2

Therefore, the ring toss game made an average of $2 per day in the remaining 57 days at the carnival.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace on average per day. We can do this by dividing the total number of visitors (829) by the number of days (85):

829/85 = 9.75

So on average, about 9.75 visitors came to the Buckingham palace each day. However, we want to know how many visitors came on the specific day that Rachel visited. We don't have that information, but we do know that 45 visitors came the day before. 

We can make an assumption that the number of visitors on Rachel's day was similar to the number of visitors the day before. So we can estimate that around 45 visitors came on Rachel's day as well. 

Therefore, we can estimate that around 45 visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the day Rachel went.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much strawberries Marco and his dad collected together before Marco lost 9 pounds. We know that they collected 24 pounds of strawberries in total. 

So, if we subtract the 9 pounds that Marco lost from the original 24 pounds, we get: 

24 - 9 = 15 

This means that before Marco lost his strawberries, they had collected 15 pounds of strawberries. 

Now we know that Marco's strawberries weigh 3 pounds. So, if we subtract 3 pounds from the 15 pounds they collected together, we get: 

15 - 3 = 12 

This means that Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 12 pounds.

Total number of items = (10 crackers + 8 cakes) / 2 = 9 items

Next, we need to divide the total number of items by the number of friends to find out how many items each person got:

Number of items per person = Total number of items / Number of friends = 9 items / 4 friends = 2.25 items per person

Since we can't give a fraction of an item, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means each person got 2 items. Since Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes, we can divide the 2 items by 2 to find out how many cakes each person got:

Number of cakes per person = 2 items / 2 = 1 cake per person

Therefore, each person ate 1 cake.

Then, some more customers arrived and the total number of customers became 8. Let's call the number of new customers "y". 

So, we can write an equation to represent the situation:

We want to find the value of "y", which represents the number of new customers. 

To solve for "y", we can rearrange the equation: 

y = 8 - x 

Now we just need to substitute the value of "x" (which is 3) into the equation: 

y = 8 - 3 

y = 5

In the afternoon, 26 campers went rowing. 

Therefore, the total number of campers who went rowing is 37 + 26 = 63. 

To find the number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all, we need to add the number of campers who went hiking in the morning.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students are in the school. We know that there are 11 students in the school, so:

Total number of students = 11

Next, we need to find out how many students are going on the trip. We know that 8 students do not want to go, so:

Number of students going on the trip = Total number of students - Number of students not going
Number of students going on the trip = 11 - 8
Number of students going on the trip = 3

Now we need to figure out how many buses are needed for the trip. We know that there are 99 seats on each bus, so:

Number of buses needed = Number of students going on the trip / Number of seats on each bus
Number of buses needed = 3 / 99
Number of buses needed = 0.03 (rounded to two decimal places)

Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need:

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

We know that the area of Jesse's room is 10 square feet. We also know that the length of her room is 5 feet. 

To find the width of her room, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: 

Area = Length x Width 

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the width: 

Width = Area / Length 

Plugging in the values we know: 

Width = 10 sq ft / 5 ft 

Simplifying: 

Width = 2 ft 

Therefore, the width of Jesse's room is 2 feet. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

First, we need to find out how many emails Jack received in the morning minus how many he received in the afternoon. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of emails received in the afternoon from the number of emails received in the morning:

10 - 7 = 3

Therefore, Jack received 3 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: There were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. How many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many roses and orchids Jessica added to the vase. 

To do this, we can subtract the original number of roses and orchids from the current number: 

Number of roses added = 12 - 5 = 7 
Number of orchids added = 2 - 3 = -1 

Uh oh, it looks like we have a negative number for the number of orchids added. This means that Jessica actually removed one orchid from the vase instead of adding one. 

So, the correct number of orchids added is: 

Number of orchids added = 3 - 2 = 1 

Now we can answer the question: 

Number of roses in the vase now = 12 
Number of orchids in the vase now = 2 

So, the difference between the number of roses and orchids in the vase now is: 

12 - 2 = 10 

Therefore, there are 10 more roses than orchids in the vase now. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 10.

First, we need to find the total number of peaches in one basket. To do that, we can add the number of red peaches and green peaches: 

19 + 4 = 23

So, each basket has 23 peaches.

Next, we need to find the total number of peaches in all 15 baskets. To do that, we can multiply the number of peaches in one basket by the number of baskets: 

23 x 15 = 345

Therefore, there are 345 peaches in the baskets altogether.

Q: Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven and 9 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 16 peaches. How many peaches does Jake have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Steven has 16 peaches. 

Next, we know that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven. So we can subtract 7 from 16 to find out how many peaches Jake has: 

16 - 7 = 9 

Therefore, Jake has 9 peaches. 

Finally, we also know that Jake has 9 more peaches than Jill. We don't know how many peaches Jill has, but we can use this information to set up an equation: 

Jake's peaches = Jill's peaches + 9 

We can substitute in the value we just found for Jake's peaches: 

9 = Jill's peaches + 9 

Subtracting 9 from both sides, we find that Jill has 0 peaches. 

So the final answer is: Jake has 9 peaches and Jill has 0 peaches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Jake has 9 peaches.

The farmer had 160 tomatoes in his garden.

He picked 56 of them yesterday.

So, the number of tomatoes left after yesterday's picking is:

160 - 56 = 104

Today, he picked 41 more tomatoes.

So, the total number of tomatoes he picked is:

56 + 41 = 97

Therefore, the number of tomatoes he has left in his garden is:

160 - 97 = 63

So, the farmer has 63 tomatoes left in his garden after yesterday's picking.

Matthew had 23 crackers.
He gave equal numbers of crackers to his 2 friends.
After giving the crackers, he has 11 crackers left.

To find out how many crackers each friend ate, we can use subtraction.

First, we need to find out how many crackers Matthew gave away. We can do this by subtracting the number of crackers he has left from the number he started with:

23 - 11 = 12

So Matthew gave away 12 crackers in total.

Since he gave an equal number of crackers to each friend, we can divide the total number of crackers he gave away by the number of friends:

12 รท 2 = 6

Therefore, each friend ate 6 crackers. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6 crackers.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps. He threw away 6 of the old ones at the park while he found 50 bottle caps new ones. Now he has 60 bottle caps in his collection. How many more bottle caps did danny find at the park than those he threw away?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he threw away the 6 old ones. We can do this by subtracting the number of new bottle caps he found from his current collection: 

60 - 50 = 10 

So Danny had 10 bottle caps before he found the new ones. 

Next, we can figure out how many bottle caps he threw away by subtracting the number he has now from the number he had before: 

10 - 6 = 4 

Therefore, Danny threw away 4 old bottle caps. 

Finally, we can calculate how many more bottle caps he found at the park than those he threw away by subtracting the number he threw away from the number he found: 

50 - 4 = 46 

So Danny found 46 more bottle caps at the park than those he threw away.

Q: Adam could fit 11 action figures on each shelf in his room. His room has 4 shelves and 40 cabinets. How many total action figures could his shelves hold?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Adam can fit 11 action figures on each shelf, and he has 4 shelves in his room. So, the total number of action figures that can be stored on one shelf is:

11 action figures/shelf x 1 shelf = 11 action figures

To find the total number of action figures that can be stored on all 4 shelves, we need to multiply the number of action figures that can be stored on one shelf by the number of shelves:

11 action figures/shelf x 4 shelves = 44 action figures

Now, we know that Adam has 40 cabinets in his room. We need to find the total number of action figures that can be stored in all the cabinets. Since we already know the number of action figures that can be stored on one shelf, we can use this information to find the total number of action figures that can be stored in all the cabinets:

44 action figures/shelf x 40 cabinets = 1760 action figures

Therefore, the total number of action figures that Adam's shelves can hold is 1760.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. We know that David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 27 to Zachary's 5 push-ups:

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 27
David's push-ups = 5 + 27
David's push-ups = 32

Next, we need to find out how many crunches David did. We know that David did 7 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 7 from Zachary's 17 crunches:

David's crunches = Zachary's crunches - 7
David's crunches = 17 - 7
David's crunches = 10

Now we can compare the number of crunches and push-ups Zachary did:

Zachary's crunches - Zachary's push-ups = 17 - 5 = 12

So Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12.

Area of the room = length x width
Area of the room = 2 feet x 12 feet
Area of the room = 24 square feet

Next, we need to calculate the area of each tile, which is given as 4 square feet.

Now, we can divide the total area of the room by the area of each tile to find out how many tiles are needed:

Number of tiles = Total area of the room / Area of each tile
Number of tiles = 24 square feet / 4 square feet
Number of tiles = 6 tiles

Therefore, Jesse needs 6 tiles to cover the whole floor of her room.

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 40
David's push-ups = 34 + 40
David's push-ups = 74

Now we need to find out how many crunches David did. We know that he did 17 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 17 from Zachary's number of crunches:

David's crunches = Zachary's crunches - 17
David's crunches = 62 - 17
David's crunches = 45

Therefore, David did 45 crunches.

First, we know that Tiffany had 4 bags of cans on Monday.

Next, we know that she found some more bags worth of cans the next day.

Let's use a variable to represent the number of bags she found on the next day. We'll call it "x".

So, we can write an equation to represent the total number of bags she had:

4 + x = 6

We want to solve for "x", so we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x = 6 - 4

x = 2

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Find the total number of drums filled in one day.
To find the total number of drums filled in one day, we need to add the number of drums of raspberries and grapes filled in one day.
Total drums filled in one day = 100 + 221 = 321

Step 2: Find the total number of drums filled in 77 days.
To find the total number of drums filled in 77 days, we need to multiply the total drums filled in one day by the number of days.
Total drums filled in 77 days = 321 x 77 = 24,717

Step 3: Find the number of drums of grapes filled in 77 days.
To find the number of drums of grapes filled in 77 days, we need to multiply the number of drums of grapes filled in one day by the number of days.
Number of drums of grapes filled in 77 days = 221 x 77 = 17,017

Therefore, 17,017 drums of grapes would be filled in 77 days.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that Marco and his dad picked strawberries together and the total weight of the strawberries they picked was 35 pounds. We also know that Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds. 

To find out how much more his dad's strawberries weighed than his, we need to subtract Marco's strawberry weight from the total weight of the strawberries they picked. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

Total weight of strawberries - Marco's strawberry weight = Dad's strawberry weight

35 - 13 = Dad's strawberry weight

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

22 = Dad's strawberry weight

Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 22 pounds, which is 9 pounds more than Marco's strawberries (22 - 13 = 9). 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

Next, we know that Doug lost some marbles at the playground. Let's say he lost y marbles. 

Now, we can use the final piece of information to set up an equation: Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. So, we can write:

x + 2 = (x - y) + 19 

Simplifying this equation, we get:

y = 17 

Therefore, Doug lost 17 marbles at the playground.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how many pencils Faye has in total from the packs of pencils. 

Faye has 6 packs of pencils, and each pack has 14 pencils. So, we can multiply 6 by 14 to get the total number of pencils in the packs:

6 x 14 = 84

So, Faye has 84 pencils from the packs.

Next, we need to figure out how many full rows of pencils she can make with the remaining pencils. 

To do this, we can divide the number of remaining pencils by the number of pencils in each row:

22 pencils per row

We can subtract the number of pencils in the packs from the total number of pencils to get the remaining pencils:

Total pencils - pencils in packs = remaining pencils

We know that Faye has 84 pencils from the packs, so we can subtract that from the total number of pencils:

Total pencils - 84 = remaining pencils

Now, we can divide the remaining pencils by 22 to find out how many full rows she can make:

remaining pencils รท 22 = number of full rows

So, the final equation is:

(Total pencils - 84) รท 22 = number

Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 66 sacks per day and that each sack containes 25 oranges. How many oranges will they have after 87 days of harvest?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many oranges are harvested in one day. We know that they harvest 66 sacks per day, and each sack contains 25 oranges. So, the total number of oranges harvested in one day is:

66 sacks/day x 25 oranges/sack = 1650 oranges/day

Next, we need to find out how many oranges are harvested in 87 days. We can do this by multiplying the number of oranges harvested in one day by the number of days:

1650 oranges/day x 87 days = 143550 oranges

Therefore, after 87 days of harvest, they will have 143550 oranges. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 143550.

Q: You had 14 bags with equal number of cookies. If you had 28 cookies and 86 candies in total How many bags of cookies do you have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent the problem. Let's say the number of cookies in each bag is "x". Then we know:

- Number of bags = 14
- Total number of cookies = 14x
- Total number of candies = 86
- Total number of items (cookies + candies) = 28 + 86 = 114

Now we can set up an equation:

14x + 86 = 114

Simplifying this equation, we get:

14x = 28

x = 2

Therefore, each bag has 2 cookies. And since we started with 14 bags, we have:

14 bags of cookies. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

Q: There were 3 dollars in Olivia's wallet. She collected 49 more dollars from an atm. After she visited a supermarket there were 49 dollars left. How much more money did she collect at the atm than she spent at the supermarket?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Olivia had after collecting 49 dollars from the ATM. We can do this by adding the initial 3 dollars to the 49 dollars she collected: 

3 + 49 = 52 

So Olivia had 52 dollars after collecting money from the ATM. 

Next, we need to find out how much money Olivia spent at the supermarket. We can do this by subtracting the 49 dollars she had left from the 52 dollars she had after collecting money from the ATM: 

52 - 49 = 3 

So Olivia spent 3 dollars at the supermarket. 

Finally, we can find out how much more money Olivia collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket by subtracting the amount she spent at the supermarket from the amount she collected at the ATM: 

49 - 3 = 46 

Therefore, Olivia collected 46 dollars more at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 46.

First, we need to find out how many letters Jack received in the morning and afternoon separately.

In the morning, Jack received 6 letters.

In the afternoon, Jack received 7 letters.

Now, we can add these two numbers to find out how many letters Jack received in the whole day.

6 + 7 = 13

Q: Jake has 13 more apples and 17 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 8 peaches and 12 apples. How many apples does Jake have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Steven has 8 peaches and Jake has 17 fewer peaches, so Jake has 8 - 17 = -9 peaches. However, this doesn't make sense since you can't have negative peaches. So, we need to adjust our approach.

Let's try a different method. We know that Jake has 13 more apples than Steven, who has 12 apples. So, Jake has 12 + 13 = 25 apples.

Now, we need to figure out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Steven has 8 peaches and Jake has 17 fewer peaches, so Jake has 8 - 17 = -9 peaches. Again, this doesn't make sense since you can't have negative peaches.

So, we need to adjust our approach again. We know that Jake has 13 more apples than Steven, who has 12 apples. We also know that Steven has 17 fewer peaches than Jake. So, we can set up two equations:

J = S + 13 (Jake has 13 more apples than Steven)
S = J - 17 (Steven has 17 fewer peaches than Jake)

 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Jake has 25 apples.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps. He found 63 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 51 old ones. Now he has 33 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found the 63 at the park. We can do this by adding the 63 he found to the 51 he threw away: 

63 + 51 = 114 

So Danny had 114 bottle caps before he found the 63 at the park. 

Next, we need to figure out how many bottle caps he had after he found the 63 and threw away the 51. We can do this by subtracting the 51 from the 63 he found: 

63 - 51 = 12 

So Danny had 12 bottle caps after he found the 63 at the park and threw away the 51 old ones. 

Finally, we need to add the 33 bottle caps he currently has to the 12 he had after finding the 63 at the park: 

33 + 12 = 45 

Therefore, Danny had 45 bottle caps at first. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 45.

Next, we know that she had to complete 6 more pages of reading homework than math homework. So, we can set up an equation: 

Reading homework = Math homework + 6 

We already know that Math homework = 8, so we can substitute that in: 

Reading homework = 8 + 6 

Simplifying, we get: 

Reading homework = 14 

Therefore, Rachel had to complete 14 pages of reading homework.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together. 

First, we need to find the total number of hours Ryan spends on learning English and Chinese each day. To do this, we can add the number of hours he spends on each subject:

4 hours (English) + 6 hours (Chinese) = 10 hours/day

Next, we need to find the average number of hours Ryan spends on each subject per day over the course of 86 days. To do this, we can divide the total number of hours by the number of days:

10 hours/day x 86 days = 860 total hours
860 total hours / 86 days = 10 hours/day

Therefore, Ryan spends an average of 4 hours on learning English and 6 hours on learning Chinese each day over the course of 86 days.

Q: During summer break 819058 kids from Lawrence county go to camp and the other 668278 kids stay home. How many more kids spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the total number of kids during summer break.
- The total number of kids is the sum of those who went to camp and those who stayed home.
- Total number of kids = 819058 + 668278 = 1488336

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the number of kids who went to camp and those who stayed home.
- To find the difference, we subtract the number of kids who stayed home from the number of kids who went to camp.
- Difference = 819058 - 668278 = 150780

Step 3: Interpret the result.
- The difference of 150780 represents the number of kids who spent their summer break at the camp compared to those who stayed home.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students can fit on one bus. Since there are 3 seats on each bus, we can multiply 3 by the number of buses needed to find the total number of students that can be transported. 

To find the number of buses needed, we can divide the total number of students by the number of students that can fit on one bus. 

So, 3 x number of buses = total number of students 

Rearranging the equation, we get: 

Number of buses = total number of students / 3 

Plugging in the given values, we get: 

Number of buses = 111 / 3 

Number of buses = 37 

Therefore, 37 buses are needed to take the trip.

Baker started with 14 cakes and 153 pastries. 

After selling 97 cakes, he has 14 - 97 = -83 cakes left (negative because he sold more cakes than he started with). 

After selling 8 pastries, he has 153 - 8 = 145 pastries left. 

Now we can find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker sold: 

-83 - (-145) = 62

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of crayons Paul had before giving away or losing any. We can do this by adding the number of crayons he gave away and the number he lost to the number he had left:

Total number of crayons = Number of crayons given away + Number of crayons lost + Number of crayons left

Total number of crayons = 52 + 535 + 492

Total number of crayons = 1079

Now we know that Paul had 1079 crayons in the beginning. We also know that he had 492 crayons left after giving away and losing some. So we can subtract the number of crayons he had left from the total number of crayons to find out how many he gave away or lost:

Number of crayons given away or lost = Total number of crayons - Number of crayons left

Number of crayons given away or lost = 1079 - 492

Number of crayons given away or lost = 587

Therefore, Paul gave away or lost 587 crayons.

Q: Haley has 20 marbles. In her class 2 boys love to play marbles. If she distributes her marbles equally How many will each of the boys receive?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how many marbles Haley will have left after giving an equal amount to the two boys. 

To do this, we can add the number of marbles the boys will receive and subtract that from the total number of marbles Haley has: 

20 - (x + x) 

where x is the number of marbles each boy will receive. 

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

20 - 2x 

Now, we know that Haley wants to distribute her marbles equally between the two boys. This means that each boy will receive the same number of marbles. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

x + x = 20 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

2x = 20 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 

x = 10 

So each boy will receive 10 marbles. 

To check our answer, we can substitute x = 10 into our expression for the number of marbles Haley will have left: 

20 - 2x = 20 - 2(10) = 0 

This means that Haley will have no marbles left after giving 10 mar

Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 27 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 41 bird families living near the mountain initially How many bird families were left near the mountain?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Initially, there were 41 bird families near the mountain. Out of these, 27 bird families flew away for the winter. 

To find out how many bird families were left near the mountain, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the initial number of bird families. 

So, the number of bird families left near the mountain would be:

41 - 27 = 14

Therefore, there were 14 bird families left near the mountain. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

Q: During summer break 61619 kids from Lawrence county stayed home and the rest went to camp. The total number of kids in Lawrence county is 91676. About how many kids in Lawrence county went to camp?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that the total number of kids in Lawrence county is 91676. And we also know that during summer break, 61619 kids stayed home. 

To find out how many kids went to camp, we can subtract the number of kids who stayed home from the total number of kids in Lawrence county:

91676 - 61619 = 30057

So about 30,057 kids in Lawrence county went to camp during summer break. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 30,057.

14 - 2 = 12 

So Dave had 12 tickets before buying any toys. 

Next, we need to subtract the number of tickets he used to buy toys:

Q: In a school there are 458 more girls than boys. If there are 692 girls How many pupils are there in that school?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to set up an equation to represent the problem. Let's use "x" to represent the number of boys in the school. 

According to the problem, there are 458 more girls than boys, so the number of girls can be represented as "x + 458". 

We also know that there are 692 girls in the school, so we can set up another equation: 

x + 458 = 692 

Now we can solve for x: 

x = 692 - 458 

x = 234 

So there are 234 boys in the school. 

To find the total number of pupils, we can add the number of boys and girls: 

Total number of pupils = 234 + 692 

Total number of pupils = 926 

Therefore, there are 926 pupils in the school. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 926.

Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 3 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 594 pages. It took Frank 607 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we can use the formula: 

Total pages = Number of chapters x Pages per chapter

Since there are 3 chapters with the same number of pages, we can represent the pages per chapter as "x". So the formula becomes:

594 = 3x

We can solve for "x" by dividing both sides by 3:

x = 198

Therefore, each chapter has 198 pages. 

Now, let's check if this answer makes sense. 

If Frank took 607 days to finish the book, we can find the average number of pages he read per day:

Average pages per day = Total pages / Number of days

Average pages per day = 594 / 607

Average pages per day โ 0.98

This means that Frank read about 1 page per day on average. Since each chapter has 198 pages, it would take him about 198 days to finish one chapter. 

So, it makes sense that it took him more than 198 days to finish the book, since he had to read more than one chapter. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 198.

155 - 140 = 15 

Therefore, the baker would still have 15 cakes left after his friend bought 140 cakes from him.

Jake had 2 balloons + 3 more balloons = 5 balloons in the park. 

Next, we need to find out how many balloons Allan had in the park. 

Allan had 6 balloons. 

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of balloons Allan had and the number of balloons Jake had in the park. 

Allan had 6 balloons - Jake had 5 balloons = 1 more balloon than Jake. 

Therefore, Allan had 1 more balloon than Jake in the park. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Total number of green and yellow peaches = 6 yellow peaches + 14 green peaches = 20 peaches 

Now, let's find the difference between the number of green and yellow peaches. 

Difference = Number of green peaches - Number of yellow peaches 

Difference = 14 green peaches - 6 yellow peaches

17 houses/block x 16 blocks = 272 houses

Next, we need to find the total number of pieces of junk mail the mailman needs to give out. We know that he needs to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house, so we can multiply the number of houses by 4:

272 houses x 4 pieces of mail/house = 1088 pieces of junk mail

Therefore, the mailman should give out a total of 1088 pieces of junk mail. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1088.

Q: There are 14 different movies and 15 different books in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 11 of the books and watched 40 of the movies How many more books than movies are there in the ' crazy silly school ' series?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the difference between the number of books and movies in the series. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of movies from the number of books: 

15 - 14 = 1 

So there is 1 more book than movie in the series. 

Next, we need to find how many more books than movies the person has read/watched. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of movies watched from the number of books read: 

11 - 40 = -29 

Uh oh, it looks like the person has watched more movies than they have read books! 

So the answer to the question "how many more books than movies are there in the 'crazy silly school' series?" is technically -1, since there is one more book than movie in the series. However, since the person has watched more movies than they have read books, we can say that they need to read 29 more books than they have watched movies to have read/watched an equal number of each. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 29.

Q: Nell collects cards. She had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left. How many more Ace cards than baseball cards does Nell have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. We can do this by subtracting the number of cards she has left from the number she started with:

- Baseball cards: 246 - 404 = -158
- Ace cards: 214 - 495 = -281

Uh oh, it looks like we have negative numbers! This means that Nell didn't just give some cards to Jeff, she gave away more than she had. Let's try a different approach.

Instead of finding out how many cards Nell gave away, let's find out how many cards she kept after giving some to Jeff. We can do this by subtracting the number of cards she gave away from the number she started with:

- Baseball cards: 246 - x = 404
- Ace cards: 214 - x = 495

To solve for x, we can subtract 214 from both sides of the second equation:

- x = 495 - 214
- x = 281

Now we know that Nell gave away 281 cards in total. To find out how many more Ace cards than baseball cards she has left, we can subtract the number of baseball cards from the number of Ace cards:

- Ace cards: 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 214 - 281 + 404 = 337. 

Nell has 337 more Ace cards than baseball cards.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of students in each classroom. We can do this by dividing the total number of students in the school (120) by the number of classrooms (24):

120 รท 24 = 5

So there are 5 students in each classroom.

Next, we need to determine how many buses are needed for the field trip. To do this, we can divide the total number of students (120) by the number of seats on each bus (84):

120 รท 84 = 1.43

Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means we need 2 buses for the field trip.

Finally, we can divide the total number of students (120) by the number of classrooms (24) to find out how many students are in each class:

120 รท 24 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 students in each class.

46 + 38 = 84

So David did 84 push-ups.

Next, we need to find out how many crunches David did. We know that David did 62 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 62 from Zachary's 58 crunches:

58 - 62 = -4

Uh oh, we got a negative number! This means that David did more push-ups than crunches, which doesn't make sense. So we need to go back and check our work.

We made a mistake when we subtracted 62 from 58. We can't subtract a larger number from a smaller number and get a positive result. Instead, we need to subtract 58 from 62 to find out how many fewer crunches David did than Zachary:

62 - 58 = 4

So David did 4 fewer crunches than Zachary.

Now we can answer the question: how many more crunches than push-ups did Zachary do? We know that Zachary did 46 push-ups and

Finally, we can divide the total number of seats by the number of students per bus to find out how many seats are in each bus. 

Total number of seats รท number of students per bus = number of seats in each bus 

So, putting it all together: 

7 buses x ? seats = total number of seats 

98 students รท 7 buses = 14 students per bus

Q: Dan has $ 5. He bought a chocolate for $ 3 and a candy bar for $ 7. How much money did he spend to buy candy bar than he did to buy chocolate?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much Dan spent on both the chocolate and the candy bar. 

He spent $3 on the chocolate and $7 on the candy bar, so in total he spent:

$3 + $7 = $10

Next, we need to figure out how much more he spent on the candy bar than he did on the chocolate. 

To do this, we can subtract the cost of the chocolate from the cost of the candy bar:

$7 - $3 = $4

So Dan spent $4 more on the candy bar than he did on the chocolate. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $4.

Q: Rachel picked 3 ripe apples from her tree. Now the tree has 2 ripe apples and 27 unripe apples. How many ripe apples did the tree have to begin with?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that Rachel picked 3 ripe apples from the tree. So, before she picked them, the tree had 3 + 2 = 5 ripe apples.

We also know that the tree now has 2 ripe apples and 27 unripe apples. So, the total number of apples on the tree now is 2 + 27 = 29.

To find out how many ripe apples the tree had to begin with, we need to subtract the number of unripe apples from the total number of apples on the tree now. So, the number of ripe apples the tree had to begin with is:

29 - 27 = 2

Therefore, the tree had 5 ripe apples to begin with. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 36 inches. 

Next, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. We are told that the frog jumped 17 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, we can add 17 to 36 to get the distance the frog jumped. 

36 + 17 = 53 

Therefore, the frog jumped 53 inches. 

Finally, we need to find out how far the mouse jumped. We are told that the mouse jumped 15 inches farther than the frog. So, we can add 15 to 53 to get the distance the mouse jumped. 

53 + 15 = 68 

Therefore, the mouse jumped 68 inches.

Q: There were some roses in the vase. Jessica cut 16 more roses from her flower garden and put them in the vase. There are now 23 roses in the vase. How many roses were there in the vase at the beginning?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to solve the problem. Let's call the number of roses in the vase at the beginning "x". 

Then, we know that Jessica cut 16 more roses and put them in the vase, so the total number of roses in the vase is now x + 16. 

We also know that there are now 23 roses in the vase, so we can set up an equation: 

x + 16 = 23 

To solve for x, we can subtract 16 from both sides: 

x = 7 

Therefore, there were 7 roses in the vase at the beginning. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many push-ups David did. We know that David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 58 to Zachary's 35 push-ups:

35 + 58 = 93

So David did 93 push-ups.

Next, we need to find out how many crunches David did. We know that David did 87 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 87 from Zachary's 3 crunches:

3 - 87 = -84

Uh oh, we got a negative number! This means that David did more push-ups than Zachary, but also more crunches. Let's switch the order of the subtraction:

87 - 3 = 84

So David did 84 less crunches than Zachary.

Now we can answer the question: how many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do? We know that Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches, so the difference is:

35 - 3 = 32

Therefore, Zachary did 32 more push-ups than crunches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 32.

Ed's marbles = Doug's marbles + 6
22 = Doug's marbles + 6

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:

16 = Doug's marbles

Now we know that Doug had 16 marbles before he lost 7 at the playground. To find out how many marbles he has now, we can subtract 7 from 16:

16 - 7 = 9

Therefore, Doug has 9 marbles now.

Q: Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, let's use variables to represent the number of apples each person has. Let A be the number of apples Adam has, J be the number of apples Jackie has, and H be the number of apples He has.

From the problem, we know that:

A + J = 12 (together they have 12 apples)
H = A + J + 9 (He has 9 more apples than Adam and Jackie together)
A = J + 8 (Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie)

We can use the third equation to substitute A in the first two equations:

J + 8 + J = 12
2J + 8 = 12
2J = 4
J = 2

So Jackie has 2 apples. We can use this to find Adam's number of apples:

A = J + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10

Now we can use the first two equations to find He's number of apples:

H = A + J + 9 = 10 + 2 + 9 = 21

Therefore, He has 21 apples.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many roses were left in the vase after Jessica threw away 33 roses. 

15 - 33 = -18 

Uh oh, we ended up with a negative number! This means that Jessica threw away more roses than there were in the vase to begin with. So we need to adjust our approach. 

Let's start over and use a different method. We know that Jessica started with 15 roses in the vase. She threw away 33 roses, so we can subtract that from the starting amount: 

15 - 33 = -18 

Again, we ended up with a negative number. This means that Jessica threw away more roses than there were in the vase to begin with. So we need to adjust our approach again. 

Let's try a different method. We know that Jessica ended up with 17 roses in the vase. We also know that she threw away 33 roses. So we can add those two numbers together to find out how many roses she started with: 

17 + 33 = 50 

So Jessica started with 50 roses in total. She threw away 33 of them, which means she was left with: 

50 - 33 = 17 

This checks out with the number

We know that the area of Jesse's room is 10 square feet. We also know that the width of the room is 2 feet. 

To find the length of the room, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: 

Area = Length x Width 

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the length: 

Length = Area / Width 

Plugging in the values we know: 

Length = 10 sq ft / 2 ft 

Length = 5 feet

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of animals in all the aquariums. To do this, we can add the number of animals in each aquarium:

Total number of animals = (number of freshwater aquariums x number of animals per aquarium) + (number of saltwater aquariums x number of animals per aquarium)
Total number of animals = (74 x 46) + (22 x 46)
Total number of animals = 3,404

Next, we need to find the number of saltwater animals. We can do this by multiplying the number of saltwater aquariums by the number of animals per aquarium:

Number of saltwater animals = number of saltwater aquariums x number of animals per aquarium
Number of saltwater animals = 22 x 46
Number of saltwater animals = 1,012

Therefore, Tyler has 1,012 saltwater animals.

We know that Nell started with 528 cards and ended up with 252 cards, so she gave away 528 - 252 = 276 cards. 

We also know that Jeff started with 11 cards and received some from Nell, so he now has x cards. 

Therefore, we can set up an equation: 

11 + x = 276 

Solving for x: 

x = 276 - 11 

x = 265 

So Nell gave Jeff 265 cards. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 265.

Q: There are 203 bananas and 63 oranges in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 7 groups and oranges are organized into 95 groups How big is each group of bananas?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bananas are in each group. To do this, we can divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups:

203 bananas / 7 groups = 29 bananas per group

So each group of bananas has 29 bananas.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges are in each group. To do this, we can divide the total number of oranges by the number of groups:

63 oranges / 95 groups = 0.66315789 oranges per group (rounded to 2 decimal places)

So each group of oranges has approximately 0.66 oranges. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 29 bananas per group.

Q: Paige raised 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond but stray cats loved eating them. Now she has 2 left. How many goldfish disappeared?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Paige had 16 goldfish and 71 catfish in the pond. Let's call the number of goldfish that disappeared "x".

So, the total number of fish in the pond before the cats ate them would be:

16 (original goldfish) + 71 (original catfish) = 87

After the cats ate some of the fish, Paige was left with only 2 fish. We can set up an equation to represent this:

87 (original total) - x (number of goldfish eaten) - (87 - x) (number of catfish eaten) = 2 (remaining fish)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x + 87 - x - 71 = 85

Solving for x, we get:

x = 29

So, 29 goldfish disappeared. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 29.

Q: Every day Ryan spends a total of 3 hours on learning english and chinese. If he spends 2 hours on learning english everyday How many hours does he spend on learning chinese?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that Ryan spends a total of 3 hours on learning English and Chinese every day. We also know that he spends 2 hours on learning English every day. 

To find out how many hours he spends on learning Chinese, we can subtract the time he spends on English from the total time he spends on both subjects. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

Total time spent - Time spent on English = Time spent on Chinese 

3 hours - 2 hours = Time spent on Chinese 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

1 hour = Time spent on Chinese 

Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour on learning Chinese every day.

Q: Baker made 43 cakes and 114 pastries. If he sold 154 pastries and 78 cakes How many more pastries than cakes did baker sell?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cakes and pastries Baker has left after selling 154 pastries and 78 cakes. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of cakes and pastries sold from the original number of cakes and pastries Baker made: 

Cakes left = 43 - 78 = -35 
Pastries left = 114 - 154 = -40 

Uh oh, it looks like we have negative numbers! This means that Baker sold more cakes and pastries than he actually made. 

So, we need to adjust the problem to make sense. Let's assume that Baker made 78 cakes and 154 pastries instead. 

Now, we can find out how many more pastries than cakes Baker sold: 

Pastries sold = 154 
Cakes sold = 78 

Difference = Pastries sold - Cakes sold 
Difference = 154 - 78 
Difference = 76 

Therefore, Baker sold 76 more pastries than cakes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 76.

Q: Each pack of dvds costs 107 dollars. If there is a discount of 106 dollars on each pack How many packs of dvds can you buy with 93 dollars?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the new price of each pack of DVDs after the discount. 

Original price of each pack = $107 
Discount on each pack = $106 
New price of each pack = $107 - $106 = $1 

Now, we need to figure out how many packs of DVDs we can buy with $93. 

Number of packs of DVDs = Total amount of money available / Price of each pack 
Number of packs of DVDs = $93 / $1 
Number of packs of DVDs = 93 

Therefore, with $93, you can buy 93 packs of DVDs after the discount. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 93.

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and some more cups of flour. She already put in 3 cups of flour. If she still needs to add 6 more cups of flour How many cups of flour did the recipe require?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and some more cups of flour. Let's call the total amount of flour needed "x". 

Next, we know that Mary has already added 3 cups of flour. 

Finally, we know that Mary still needs to add 6 more cups of flour. 

Putting all of this together, we can create an equation: 

3 + 6 + x = total amount of flour needed 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

9 + x = total amount of flour needed 

To solve for "x", we can subtract 9 from both sides: 

x = total amount of flour needed - 9 

We know that Mary needs to add a total of x cups of flour, so we can substitute this expression into the original equation: 

3 + 6 + x = 11 + x 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

9 + x = 11 + x 

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: 

9 = 11 

This is not a true statement, so we know that our original assumption that Mary needs to add x cups of flour must be incorrect. 

To find the correct amount of flour needed, we can use

Next, we know that some more children got on the bus at the stop, and the total number of children on the bus became 16. So, we can set up an equation:

11 + x = 16

where x is the number of children who got on the bus at the stop.

To solve for x, we can subtract 11 from both sides:

x = 16 - 11

x = 5

Q: Jesse's room is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide. If she already has 16 square feet of carpet How much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total area of Jesse's room. We can do this by multiplying the length and width of the room:

11 feet x 15 feet = 165 square feet

Next, we need to subtract the area of the room that is already covered by carpet:

165 square feet - 16 square feet = 149 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs 149 square feet of additional carpet to cover the whole floor. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 149.

Q: Dan has $ 3 left with him after he bought a candy bar for $ 2. How much money did he have initially?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

Dan bought a candy bar for $2, so we can subtract that from his initial amount of money. 

Initial amount of money - $2 (cost of candy bar) = $3 (remaining amount of money)

To find the initial amount of money, we need to add the $2 cost of the candy bar to the remaining $3 that Dan has. 

Initial amount of money = $2 (cost of candy bar) + $3 (remaining amount of money) 

Therefore, Dan initially had $5. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $5.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he threw away the old ones and found the new ones. We can do this by adding the number of old ones he threw away to the number of new ones he found and then adding that to the number he has now:

54 old ones + 48 new ones + 52 he has now = 154 total bottle caps

Next, we need to find out how many bottle caps he had before he threw away the old ones:

154 total - 54 old ones = 100 bottle caps before he threw away the old ones

Finally, we can find out how many more bottle caps he threw away than he found by subtracting the number of new ones he found from the number of old ones he threw away:

54 old ones - 48 new ones = 6 more old ones than new ones

Therefore, Danny threw away 6 more old bottle caps than he found new ones at the park.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many sweet cookies Paco had left after eating 32 of them. To do this, we can subtract 32 from 39:

39 - 32 = 7

So Paco had 7 sweet cookies left.

Next, we need to find out how many salty cookies Paco had left after eating 23 of them. To do this, we can subtract 23 from 6:

6 - 23 = -17

Uh oh, we have a problem here. Paco can't have negative cookies! This means that Paco ate more salty cookies than he had to begin with. Let's assume that Paco had 0 salty cookies left after eating all 23 of them.

Now we can find out how many more sweet cookies Paco ate than salty cookies. To do this, we can subtract the number of salty cookies Paco ate from the number of sweet cookies he ate:

32 - 0 = 32

So Paco ate 32 more sweet cookies than salty cookies. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 32.

Q: An industrial machine can make 3 shirts a minute. It made 4 shirts yesterday and 8 shirts today. How many minutes did the machine work in all?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

The machine can make 3 shirts in 1 minute. 

Yesterday, it made 4 shirts. 

Today, it made 8 shirts. 

We need to find out how many minutes the machine worked in total. 

To do this, we can use a formula: 

Total shirts made = rate of production x time 

Let's use this formula to find out how long the machine worked yesterday: 

4 shirts = 3 shirts/minute x time 

Solving for time: 

time = 4 shirts / (3 shirts/minute) 

time = 1.33 minutes 

So, the machine worked for 1.33 minutes yesterday. 

Now, let's use the same formula to find out how long the machine worked today: 

8 shirts = 3 shirts/minute x time 

Solving for time: 

time = 8 shirts / (3 shirts/minute) 

time = 2.67 minutes 

So, the machine worked for 2.67 minutes today. 

To find out the total time the machine worked, we just need to add the time from yesterday and today: 

Total time = 1.33 minutes + 2.67 minutes 

Total time = 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4 minutes.

Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 555 pages equally distributed over 5 chapters. It took Frank 220 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we need to find out how many pages Frank read per day. We can do this by dividing the total number of pages by the number of days it took him to finish the book:

555 pages รท 220 days = 2.52 pages per day

Next, we need to find out how many pages are in each chapter. Since the pages are equally distributed over 5 chapters, we can divide the total number of pages by 5:

555 pages รท 5 chapters = 111 pages per chapter

Therefore, each chapter has 111 pages. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 111 pages per chapter.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the total number of bottles is 17. 

Next, we know that 9 of those bottles are regular soda. 

To find out how many bottles of diet soda there are, we can subtract the number of regular soda bottles from the total number of bottles: 

17 - 9 = 8 

So there are 8 bottles of diet soda. 

Finally, we also know that the store has 29 apples, but this information is not needed to solve the question.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that How many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days. 

To do this, we can add up the number of visitors on each of those days: 

191 + 457 + ... (we don't know the rest) 

We can represent the unknown number of visitors on the remaining days as "x". 

So the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days is: 

191 + 457 + x 

Next, we need to find the difference between the total number of visitors in the previous 245 days and the number of visitors on the day Rachel visited the Buckingham palace: 

705 - (191 + 457 + x) 

Simplifying this expression: 

705 - 648 - x 

57 - x 

So the difference between the number of visitors on Rachel's day and the previous 245 days is 57 - x. 

However, we don't know the value of x, so we can't find the exact difference. We would need more information about the number of visitors on the remaining days to calculate x. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 57 - x.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

First, we need to find the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence. We know that there are 4 birds and 3 storks already sitting on the fence, so:

Total number of birds and storks = 4 + 3 = 7

Next, we need to find out how many storks came to join them. We know that 6 more storks came to join, so:

Total number of storks = 3 + 6 = 9

Finally, we need to find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence. We can do this by subtracting the number of birds from the number of storks:

Number of storks - Number of birds = 9 - 4 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 more storks than birds sitting on the fence. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

Q: Rachel picked 7 apples from her tree. Thereafter 2 new apples grew on the tree. Now the tree has 6 apples still on it. How many apples did the tree have to begin with?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

First, Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree. So, the tree had some apples before she picked them.

Let's assume the tree had x apples to begin with.

After Rachel picked 7 apples, the tree had x - 7 apples left.

Then, 2 new apples grew on the tree. So, the total number of apples on the tree became (x - 7) + 2 = x - 5.

Finally, we are told that the tree has 6 apples still on it. So, we can set up an equation:

x - 5 = 6

Solving for x, we get:

x = 11

Therefore, the tree had 11 apples to begin with. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 11.

Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 

Next, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. We know that the frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can add 39 to 19: 

19 + 39 = 58 

So the frog jumped 58 inches. 

Finally, we need to find out how far the mouse jumped. We know that the mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog, so we can subtract 94 from 58: 

58 - 94 = -36 

Uh oh, we have a problem! A negative distance doesn't make sense. We made a mistake somewhere. 

Let's go back and check our work. We added 39 to 19 to get 58, which seems correct. But then we subtracted 94 from 58, which doesn't make sense. 

Instead, we should subtract 94 from the frog's jump distance: 

58 - 94 = -36 

Nope, still not right. We made another mistake. 

Let's try again. This time, we'll subtract 94 from the frog's jump distance correctly: 

58 - 94 = -36

Next, we know that the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, we can add 33 to 9 to get the distance the frog jumped: 

9 + 33 = 42 inches 

Finally, we know that the mouse jumped 3 inches less than the frog. So, we can subtract 3 from 42 to get the distance the mouse jumped: 

42 - 3 = 39 inches 

Therefore, the mouse jumped 39 inches.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game. We can do this by subtracting the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold:

95 total t-shirts - 47 t-shirts sold during Arkansas game = 48 t-shirts sold during Texas Tech game

Now that we know how many t-shirts were sold during each game, we can calculate the total amount of money made from selling the t-shirts:

$87 profit per t-shirt x 95 total t-shirts = $8,265 total profit

So the Razorback t-shirt shop made $8,265 from selling the 95 t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech games.

We know that there are 6 houses on the block and the mailman has to give 24 pieces of junk mail to each block. So, the total number of pieces of junk mail that the mailman has to give to the block is:

6 houses x 24 pieces of junk mail = 144 pieces of junk mail

Now, we need to find how many pieces of junk mail the mailman should give in each house. To do this, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the number of houses on the block:

144 pieces of junk mail รท 6 houses = 24 pieces of junk mail

Therefore, the mailman should give 24 pieces of junk mail in each house.

Recipe requirement: 9 cups of flour 
Flour already added: 12 cups 
12 cups - 9 cups = 3 cups 

Mary has added 3 cups of flour more than the recipe requires. 

Next, we need to find out how much more sugar Mary needs to add to reach the recipe's requirement. 

Recipe requirement: 11 cups of sugar 
Sugar already added: 10 cups 
11 cups - 10 cups = 1 cup

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill, and we also know that Steven has 4 peaches. So, we can use this information to find out how many peaches Jill has. 

If Steven has 4 peaches and 11 more than Jill, then Jill must have 4 - 11 = -7 peaches. However, this doesn't make sense since you can't have negative peaches. So, we need to adjust our thinking. 

Instead, let's say that Steven has 4 peaches and 11 more than Jill, so Jill has 4 - 11 = -7 fewer peaches than Steven. This means that Steven has 7 more peaches than Jill. 

Now we also know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. Since Steven has 4 peaches and 7 more than Jill, we can calculate that Steven has 4 + 7 = 11 peaches. 

Therefore, Jake has 11 - 12 = -1 peach, which again doesn't make sense. So, we need to adjust our thinking again. 

Let's say that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 11 - 12 = -1 fewer pe

A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assign a variable to represent the number of cups of flour Mary has already put in. Let's call it "f". 

According to the problem, Mary still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. So, we can set up an equation: 

f + 2 = 7 

This equation represents the fact that Mary needs 2 more cups of flour than the 7 cups of sugar. 

Now, we can solve for "f":

So Paul originally had 1453 crayons. 

Now we can subtract the number of crayons he had left from the original number to find out how many he got for his birthday:

We know that there are 2 baskets of peaches, and each basket has 4 red peaches. So, the total number of red peaches is 2 x 4 = 8.

We also know that there are a total of 12 peaches in both baskets. So, if we subtract the number of red peaches from the total number of peaches, we can find the number of green peaches in both baskets.

12 - 8 = 4

So, there are 4 green peaches in both baskets combined. 

Since we want to know how many green peaches are in each basket, we can divide this number by 2 (since there are 2 baskets).

4 รท 2 = 2

Therefore, there are 2 green peaches in each basket. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2 green peaches in each basket.

Q: Jerry had 5 action figures and 2 books on a shelf in his room. Later he added 9 more books to the shelf. How many more books than action figures were on his shelf?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

First, we need to find out how many items Jerry had on his shelf in total. To do this, we can add the number of action figures and books:

5 action figures + 2 books = 7 items

Next, we need to find out how many books Jerry added to the shelf:

9 books

Q: There are 10 peaches distributed equally in some baskets. If each basket has 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches How many baskets of peaches are there?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that there are 10 peaches distributed equally in some baskets. Let's call the number of baskets "x". 

So, the total number of peaches in all the baskets is 10x. 

We also know that each basket has 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches. Therefore, the total number of peaches in each basket is 4 + 6 = 10. 

Since the peaches are distributed equally, we can set up an equation: 

10x = 10 

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 10: 

x = 1 

Therefore, there is only one basket of peaches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: Jesse has 18 square feet of carpet. If her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide How much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total area of the room. We can do this by multiplying the length and width of the room:

Area of the room = length x width
Area of the room = 4 feet x 20 feet
Area of the room = 80 square feet

Next, we need to find out how much carpet Jesse needs to cover the whole floor. We know she already has 18 square feet of carpet, so we can subtract that from the total area of the room:

Amount of carpet needed = total area of the room - amount of carpet Jesse already has
Amount of carpet needed = 80 square feet - 18 square feet
Amount of carpet needed = 62 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs 62 square feet of additional carpet to cover the whole floor. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 62.

Next, we need to find out how many old games they have altogether after Katie's new games are added. 

We don't know how many new games Katie's friends have, so we can't add those yet. Let's focus on Katie first. 

Katie has 62 new games, so her total number of games is:

80 + 62 = 142 games

Now we can add the old games from Katie's friends:

121 + 73 = 194 old games

So, Katie and her friends have a total of 194 old games.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we need to find out how many pages are in each chapter. To do this, we can divide the total number of pages (193) by the number of chapters (15):

193 รท 15 = 12.87

We can round this to the nearest whole number, which gives us:

Each chapter has approximately 13 pages.

Next, we need to find out how many pages Frank read per day. To do this, we can divide the total number of pages (193) by the number of days it took him to finish the book (660):

193 รท 660 = 0.2924

We can round this to two decimal places, which gives us:

Frank read approximately 0.29 pages per day.

Finally, we can find out how many chapters Frank read per day by dividing the number of pages he read per day (0.29) by the number of pages in each chapter (13):

0.29 รท 13 = 0.0223

We can round this to four decimal places, which gives us:

Frank read approximately 0.0223 chapters per day.

Therefore, Frank read approximately 0.0223 chapters per day.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Let's assume that Kelly had "x" number of Nintendo games initially.

According to the problem, Kelly gives away 91 Nintendo games. So, the number of games she has left is:

x - 91

But we also know that Kelly still has 92 games left. So, we can set up an equation:

x - 91 = 92

Now, we can solve for "x" by adding 91 to both sides of the equation:

x - 91 + 91 = 92 + 91

x = 183

Therefore, Kelly initially had 183 Nintendo games.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many oranges are in 16 sacks. We can do this by multiplying the number of oranges in one sack (57) by the number of sacks harvested per day (16):

57 x 16 = 912

So, 16 sacks contain 912 oranges.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges are in 80 sacks. We can do this by multiplying the number of oranges in 16 sacks (912) by 5 (since 80 is 5 times larger than 16):

912 x 5 = 4560

So, 80 sacks contain 4560 oranges.

Finally, we need to find out how many days it will take to harvest 80 sacks of oranges if they harvest 16 sacks per day. We can do this by dividing the total number of sacks (80) by the number of sacks harvested per day (16):

80 รท 16 = 5

A: Let's think step by step. Olivia spent 78 dollars at the supermarket and has 33 dollars left with her. 

We can use subtraction to find out how much money she had initially. 

Initial money = Money spent + Money left 

Initial money = 78 dollars + 33 dollars 

Initial money = 111 dollars 

Therefore, Olivia had 111 dollars initially.

Q: Randy has 97 blocks. He uses some blocks to build a tower. If there are 72 blocks left How many blocks did he use to build the tower?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Randy started with 97 blocks. Then, he used some blocks to build a tower. Let's call the number of blocks he used "x". 

So, Randy started with 97 blocks and used x blocks to build the tower. This means he had 97 - x blocks left over. 

We also know that there were 72 blocks left over after he built the tower. So we can set up an equation: 

97 - x = 72 

To solve for x, we can subtract 72 from both sides: 

97 - 72 - x = 0 

Simplifying: 

25 - x = 0 

Now we can add x to both sides: 

25 = x 

So Randy used 25 blocks to build the tower. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 25.

Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 14 inches. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog who jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper. How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. We know that the frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, so:

Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 37
Frog's jump = 14 + 37
Frog's jump = 51 inches

Now we need to find out how far the mouse jumped. We know that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, so:

Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 16
Mouse's jump = 51 - 16
Mouse's jump = 35 inches

Finally, we need to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper. We can do this by subtracting the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump:

Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump = 35 - 14 = 21 inches

Therefore, the mouse jumped 21 inches farther than the grasshopper. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 21.

Q: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 46 wrappers and 50 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how many more bottle caps and wrappers Danny found at the park. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps and wrappers he had before going to the park from the number he found at the park:

Bottle caps found at the park = 50
Wrappers found at the park = 46

Total bottle caps = 50 + 21 = 71
Total wrappers = 46 + 52 = 98

Now we can find the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers:

Difference = Total bottle caps - Total wrappers
Difference = 71 - 98
Difference = -27

Since the difference is negative, it means that Danny found 27 more wrappers than bottle caps at the park. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 27 more wrappers than bottle caps.

Q: Paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday. By the end of the school year he had either lost or given away 551 of them and only had 177 left. How many crayons did he get for his birthday?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Let's start by figuring out how many crayons Paul had in total before losing or giving away any. We can do this by adding the number of crayons he had left at the end of the school year (177) to the number he lost or gave away (551). 

177 + 551 = 728

So Paul had 728 crayons in total.

Step 2: Now we need to figure out how many crayons he got for his birthday. Let's call this number "x". We know that he started with x crayons, and then lost or gave away 551, leaving him with 177. 

x - 551 = 177

Step 3: We can solve for x by adding 551 to both sides of the equation. 

x - 551 + 551 = 177 + 551

x = 728

So Paul got 728 crayons for his birthday. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 728.

We know that:

- 92 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the day Rachel visited.
- 419 visitors came the previous day.
- 103 visitors came the day before that.

We need to find out how many visitors came before the day Rachel visited.

To do that, we can add up the number of visitors from the previous days:

419 + 103 = 522

Next, we need to figure out how many hours he spends on learning Chinese. We know that the total time he spends on both subjects is 4 hours. So, we can set up an equation: 

3 + x = 4 

Here, x represents the number of hours Ryan spends on learning Chinese. 

To solve for x, we can subtract 3 from both sides: 

x = 1

First, we need to find out how many cups of flour Mary has already put in. The problem tells us that she has put in 5 cups of flour.

Next, we need to figure out how many cups of sugar and salt she needs to add. The recipe calls for 8 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt.

To find out how many more cups of sugar than salt she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of salt from the amount of sugar. So, 8 cups of sugar minus 7 cups of salt equals 1 cup.

Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of sugar than cups of salt.

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar How many more cups of flour does she need to add?
A: Let's think step by step. First, let's assign a variable to represent the number of cups of flour Mary has already put in. Let's call it "f". 

According to the problem, the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. So, Mary still needs to add (6 - f) cups of flour. 

The problem also states that she needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. So, we can set up an equation: 

6 - f = 13 - f + 8 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

6 - f = 21 - f 

Adding "f" to both sides, we get: 

6 = 21 

This is not a true statement, which means there is no solution that satisfies the conditions of the problem. 

Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement. Perhaps the problem meant to say that Mary needs 8 more cups of sugar than flour? In that case, we can set up a new equation: 

6 + f = 13 + f + 8 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

6 + f = 21 + f 

Subtracting "f" from both sides, we get: 

6 = 21 

 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is There is no solution that satisfies the conditions of the problem.

We know that Luke scored a total of 84 points after playing 2 rounds of a trivia game. We also know that he gained the same number of points each round. 

To find out how many points he scored per round, we can use algebra. Let's call the number of points he scored in each round "x". 

So, we can set up an equation: 

x + x = 84 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

2x = 84 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2: 

x = 42 

Therefore, Luke scored 42 points per round.

We know that 15 campers went rowing in the morning. Let's call the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon "x". 

So, the total number of campers who went rowing that day is 15 + x. 

And we also know that the total number of campers who went rowing that day is 32. 

So we can set up an equation: 

15 + x = 32 

To solve for x, we can subtract 15 from both sides:

First, we need to find the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence. We are given that there are 2 birds and 6 storks already on the fence, so:

Total number of birds and storks = 2 + 6 = 8

Next, we are told that 3 more birds join them. So, we need to add 3 to the number of birds already on the fence:

Total number of birds = 2 + 3 = 5

Now, we can find the number of storks by subtracting the number of birds from the total number of birds and storks:

Total number of storks = 8 - 5 = 3

Finally, we need to find the difference between the number of storks and birds:

Difference = Total number of storks - Total number of birds = 3 - 5 = -2

Since the difference is negative, it means that there are 2 more birds than storks sitting on the fence.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Find the total number of drums filled in one day.
To find the total number of drums filled in one day, we need to add the number of drums of grapes and raspberries filled in one day.
Total drums filled in one day = 244 + 47 = 291

Step 2: Find the total number of drums filled in 146 days.
To find the total number of drums filled in 146 days, we need to multiply the total drums filled in one day by the number of days.
Total drums filled in 146 days = 291 x 146 = 42486

Step 3: Find the number of drums of grapes filled in 146 days.
To find the number of drums of grapes filled in 146 days, we need to multiply the total number of drums filled in 146 days by the fraction of drums of grapes filled in one day.
Fraction of drums of grapes filled in one day = 244/291
Number of drums of grapes filled in 146 days = 42486 x (244/291) = 35640

Therefore, the number of drums of grapes filled in 146 days is 35640. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 35640.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Olivia had after collecting 148 dollars from the ATM. We can do this by adding the amount she had in her wallet to the amount she collected from the ATM:

100 + 148 = 248

So, Olivia had 248 dollars after collecting money from the ATM.

Next, we need to find out how much money Olivia spent at the supermarket. We can do this by subtracting the amount she had left from the amount she had after collecting money from the ATM:

248 - 159 = 89

Therefore, Olivia spent 89 dollars at the supermarket. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 89.

Q: Steven has 19 peaches. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven and 72 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jake have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many peaches Jill has. We know that Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill, so we can set up an equation:

Jill's peaches + 72 = Jake's peaches

We don't know Jill's peaches yet, so let's call that "J". Now our equation looks like this:

J + 72 = Jake's peaches

Next, we know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. We can set up another equation:

Jake's peaches + 12 = Steven's peaches

We don't know Jake's peaches yet, but we just found an equation for it. So we can substitute that into this equation:

(J + 72) + 12 = 19

Now we can solve for J:

J + 84 = 19

J = -65

Uh oh, that doesn't make sense! We can't have negative peaches. Let's go back and check our work.

We made a mistake in our second equation. It should be:

Steven's peaches - 12 = Jake's peaches

So let's fix that and try again:

(J + 72) = Steven's peaches - 12

(J + 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is Jake has 29 peaches.

Q: Paul got a box of 601 crayons and 406 erasers for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 336 crayons left while not having lost a single eraser. How many more erasers than crayons did he have left?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crayons Paul used during the school year. We can do this by subtracting the number of crayons he had left from the number he started with: 

601 - 336 = 265 crayons used 

Next, we need to find out how many more erasers Paul had left compared to crayons. We can do this by subtracting the number of crayons left from the number of erasers he started with: 

406 - 336 = 70 erasers left 

Therefore, Paul had 70 more erasers than crayons left at the end of the school year. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 70.

Q: Baker made 144 cakes. He sold 71 of them. Then he made 111 more cakes. How many more cakes did baker make than those he sold?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cakes Baker has left after selling 71 of them. We can do this by subtracting 71 from 144:

144 - 71 = 73

So Baker has 73 cakes left. 

Next, we need to find out how many cakes Baker made in total. We know he made 144 initially, and then he made 111 more:

144 + 111 = 255

So Baker made 255 cakes in total. 

Finally, we need to find out how many more cakes Baker made than those he sold. We can do this by subtracting the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made:

255 - 71 = 184

Therefore, Baker made 184 more cakes than those he sold. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 184.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to add the number of cakes Baker made initially and the number of cakes he made later. 

62 + 149 = 211 

So, Baker had 211 cakes in total. 

Next, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he had. 

211 - 144 = 67 

Therefore, Baker would still have 67 cakes left after selling 144 cakes.

Q: Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent the problem. Let's say that Jackie has x apples. Then, Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, so Adam has x + 4 apples. Together, they have 14 apples, so we can write an equation:

x + (x + 4) = 14

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + 4 = 14

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:

2x = 10

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 5

So Jackie has 5 apples, and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples. 

Now we know that Adam and Jackie together have 14 apples, so we can find out how many apples Bob has. Bob has 6 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so we can write:

Bob = 6 + (Adam + Jackie)

Substituting in the values we found earlier, we get:

Bob = 6 + (9 + 5)

Simplifying, we get:

Bob = 20

So Bob has 20 apples. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 20.

A: Let's think step by step. To find out how many packs of DVDs you can buy, you need to divide the total amount of money you have by the cost of each pack. 

So, to solve this problem, you can use the following formula:

Number of packs = Total amount of money / Cost per pack

Substituting the given values, we get:

Number of packs = 104 dollars / 26 dollars per pack

Simplifying the expression, we get:

Number of packs = 4 packs

Therefore, you can buy 4 packs of DVDs with 104 dollars if each pack costs 26 dollars.

43 - 25 = 18 

This means that before he ate the additional 25 pieces, he had already eaten 18 pieces. Therefore, Bobby had eaten 18 pieces of candy at the start.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Julia played tag with 16 kids on Monday. 

Next, we know that she played with 12 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday. So, we can set up an equation: 

Monday's number of kids = Tuesday's number of kids + 12 

We can substitute the known value for Monday's number of kids: 

16 = Tuesday's number of kids + 12 

Now we can solve for Tuesday's number of kids: 

Tuesday's number of kids = 16 - 12 

Tuesday's number of kids = 4 

Therefore, Julia played tag with 4 kids on Tuesday. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

Q: After a typhoon, 13 trees in Haley's backyard died. If she had grown 3 trees initially How many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many trees survived the typhoon. To do that, we need to subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees before the typhoon. 

Total number of trees before the typhoon = 13 (dead trees) + 3 (initially grown trees) + X (surviving trees)

We don't know the value of X yet, so let's leave it as it is for now. 

Now, we can simplify the equation: 

Total number of trees before the typhoon = 16 + X 

Next, we need to find out how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived. To do that, we need to subtract the number of surviving trees from the number of dead trees. 

Number of trees that died - Number of trees that survived = 13 - X 

So, the answer to the question is 13 - X. We don't know the value of X yet, so we can't give a specific answer.

Step 1: Find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed.
We know that together, Marco and his dad's strawberries weighed 4 pounds. We also know that Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds. So, we can subtract Marco's weight from the total weight to find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed.
Dad's strawberries = Total weight - Marco's strawberries
Dad's strawberries = 4 - 19
Dad's strawberries = -15

Step 2: Analyze the result.
We got a negative value for his dad's strawberries, which doesn't make sense. This means there must be an error in our calculation or in the problem itself. Let's double-check the problem statement.

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 86 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 232 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 254 t-shirts and 43 jerseys. How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

First, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from selling t-shirts and jerseys. To do this, we can use the following formula:

Total revenue = (number of t-shirts sold x revenue per t-shirt) + (number of jerseys sold x revenue per jersey)

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Total revenue = (254 x 86) + (43 x 232)
Total revenue = 21844

So, the total revenue generated from selling t-shirts and jerseys during the game was $21844.

Next, we need to find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt. To do this, we can subtract the revenue generated from selling t-shirts from the revenue generated from selling jerseys:

Revenue from selling jerseys - Revenue from selling t-shirts = (43 x 232) - (254 x 86)
Revenue from selling jerseys - Revenue from selling t-shirts = 9944 - 21844
Revenue from selling jerseys - Revenue from selling t-shirts = -11900

Since the result is negative, it means that a t-shirt costs more than a jersey. Specifically, a jersey costs $11900 less than a t-shirt. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $11900.

So, 31 packs of pencils x 6 pencils in each pack = 186 pencils in total.

Next, we need to figure out how many rows of pencils Faye can make with 19 pencils in each row. To do this, we can divide the total number of pencils by 19. 

186 pencils รท 19 pencils per row = 9.79 rows (rounded to the nearest whole number).

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we'll round down to 9 rows. 

Finally, we can find out how many pencils are left over after making 9 rows of 19 pencils each. To do this, we can subtract the number of pencils used in the rows from the total number of pencils. 

9 rows x 19 pencils per row = 171 pencils used in the rows.

186 pencils in total - 171 pencils used in the rows = 15 pencils left over.

Therefore, Faye has a total of 186 pencils, which can be 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 186 pencils.

Q: Paco had 8 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies. He ate 20 sweet cookies and 34 salty cookies. How many more salty cookies than sweet cookies did he eat?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Find out how many sweet cookies Paco has left after eating 20 sweet cookies.
Paco had 8 sweet cookies and ate 20 sweet cookies, so he has 8 - 20 = -12 sweet cookies left. This means he ate more sweet cookies than he had.

Step 2: Find out how many salty cookies Paco has left after eating 34 salty cookies.
Paco had 6 salty cookies and ate 34 salty cookies, so he has 6 - 34 = -28 salty cookies left. This means he ate more salty cookies than he had.

Step 3: Find out how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies Paco ate.
To find out how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies Paco ate, we need to find the difference between the number of salty cookies he ate and the number of sweet cookies he ate. 
So, the difference is 34 - 20 = 14. This means Paco ate 14 more salty cookies than sweet cookies. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

Q: Lucy went to the grocery store. She bought 2 packs of cookie and 12 packs of cake. In the end she had 56 amount of change remaining. How many packs of groceries did she buy in all?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find out the total cost of the groceries that Lucy bought. We can do this by adding the cost of the cookie packs and the cake packs.

Let's assume that each pack of cookie costs $x and each pack of cake costs $y.

So, the total cost of the cookie packs would be 2x and the total cost of the cake packs would be 12y.

Therefore, the total cost of all the groceries that Lucy bought would be:

Total cost = 2x + 12y

Now, we know that Lucy had 56 amount of change remaining. This means that she spent some amount of money and got back 56 dollars as change.

So, we can write an equation for this as:

2x + 12y + 56 = Total amount spent

But we don't know the value of the total amount spent. So, we need to find it out.

Let's assume that the total amount spent is $z.

So, the equation becomes:

2x + 12y + 56 = z

Now, we need to find out the value of z.

We can do this by using the information given in the problem. We know that 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is not provided in the problem. We need to solve for z to find the total number of packs of groceries that Lucy bought.

Q: Paul got a box of 267 crayons for his birthday. During the school year he lost 231 crayons while he gave away 308 crayons to his friends. How many more crayons did he give to his friends than those he lost?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crayons Paul had left after losing 231 crayons. We can do this by subtracting 231 from 267:

267 - 231 = 36

So Paul had 36 crayons left after losing 231.

Next, we need to find out how many crayons Paul had left after giving away 308 crayons to his friends. We can do this by subtracting 308 from 36:

36 - 308 = -272

Uh oh, we ended up with a negative number! This means that Paul gave away more crayons than he had left. To find out how many more crayons he gave away than those he lost, we can take the absolute value of -272:

|-272| = 272

So Paul gave away 272 more crayons than those he lost. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 272.

30 + 8 = 38 

So the grocery store had 38 bottles of soda in total. 

Next, we add the number of apples: 

38 + 41 = 79 

So the grocery store had a total of 79 items (bottles of soda and apples combined).

Next, we need to subtract the number of blocks he used from the total number of blocks he had. We know that he had 59 blocks.

So, the equation would be:

59 - 36 = ?

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Q: Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 27 of his marbles at the playground while Ed found 9 more marbles. How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Let's start by figuring out how many marbles Doug had before he lost 27 of them. We know that Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, so we can set up an equation:

Ed's marbles = Doug's marbles + 24

Let's call Doug's marbles "x". Then we can rewrite the equation as:

Ed's marbles = x + 24

Step 2: We know that Doug lost 27 marbles, so we can subtract that from his original number of marbles:

Doug's marbles after losing 27 = x - 27

Step 3: We also know that Ed found 9 more marbles, so we can add that to his original number of marbles:

Ed's marbles after finding 9 = (x + 24) + 9

Step 4: Now we can find the difference between the number of marbles Ed and Doug have:

Difference = Ed's marbles after finding 9 - Doug's marbles after losing 27

Difference = (x + 24 + 9) - (x - 27)

Difference = x + 33 - x +  
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 33.

Q: Steven has 12 peaches. Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven who has 67 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jake have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Steven has 12 peaches. 

Next, we know that Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill. Let's call the number of peaches Jill has "J". So, we can write an equation: 

Steven = Jill + 67 

We can substitute in the value we know for Steven: 

12 = J + 67 

Solving for J, we get: 

J = -55 

This means that Jill has -55 peaches, which doesn't make sense. So, we made a mistake somewhere. 

Let's try a different approach. We know that Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we can write an equation: 

Jake = Steven - 4 

We also know that Steven has 12 peaches. So, we can substitute in that value: 

Jake = 12 - 4 

Simplifying, we get: 

Jake = 8 

Therefore, Jake has 8 peaches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

Q: Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework How many pages did she have to complete in all?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent the problem. Let's call the number of pages of reading homework "r". 

According to the problem, Rachel had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework. So, the number of pages of math homework she had to complete is "r + 3". 

We know that she had to complete a total of 8 pages of math homework. So, we can set up an equation: 

r + (r + 3) = 8 

Simplifying this equation: 

2r + 3 = 8 

Subtracting 3 from both sides: 

2r = 5 

Dividing both sides by 2: 

r = 2.5 

So, Rachel had to complete 2.5 pages of reading homework. 

To find out how many pages she had to complete in all, we can add the number of pages of math and reading homework: 

2.5 + (2.5 + 3) = 8 

So, Rachel had to complete a total of 8 pages of homework.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many marbles Haley gave away in total. If she gave 5 marbles to each boy, and we don't know how many boys there are, we can use a variable to represent the number of boys. Let's call it "b". 

So, the total number of marbles Haley gave away is 5b. 

We know that Haley started with 10 marbles, so we can set up an equation: 

10 - 5b = 0 

We want to solve for "b", so we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

First, we can subtract 10 from both sides: 

-5b = -10 

Then, we can divide both sides by -5: 

b = 2 

So, Haley gave the marbles to 2 boys. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

Let's assume that Jerry had x action figures on the shelf initially.

Then, he added 7 more action figures to the shelf.

So, the total number of action figures on the shelf now is x + 7.

According to the problem, the total number of action figures on the shelf now is 10.

So, we can write an equation as follows:

x + 7 = 10

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:

x + 7 - 7 = 10 - 7

x = 3

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug, so we can set up an equation: 

E = D + 30 

where E represents the number of marbles Ed had and D represents the number of marbles Doug had. 

Next, we know that Ed lost 21 marbles at the playground, so we can subtract that from the original number of marbles he had: 

E - 21 = 91 

Now we can solve for E: 

E = 112 

So Ed originally had 112 marbles. 

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we can substitute E = 112 into our first equation: 

112 = D + 30 

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 

D = 82 

So Doug had 82 marbles. 

To find the difference between the two, we can subtract: 

112 - 82 = 30 

Therefore, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug.

A: Let's think step by step. To find the cost of each t-shirt, we need to divide the total amount earned by the number of t-shirts sold. 

So, we have:

Cost of each t-shirt = Total amount earned / Number of t-shirts sold

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Cost of each t-shirt = $51 / 3

Simplifying the division, we get:

Cost of each t-shirt = $17

Therefore, the cost of each t-shirt is $17.

Q: He also had 56 aquariums for saltwater animals and 10 aquariums for freshwater animals. Each aquarium has 39 animals in it. How many saltwater animals does Tyler have?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we need to find the total number of animals in all the aquariums. To do this, we can add the number of animals in each aquarium:

Total number of animals = (number of saltwater aquariums x number of animals per saltwater aquarium) + (number of freshwater aquariums x number of animals per freshwater aquarium)

Total number of animals = (56 x 39) + (10 x 39)

Total number of animals = 2184

Next, we need to find the number of saltwater animals. We know that all the animals in the freshwater aquariums are freshwater animals, so we can subtract the number of freshwater animals from the total number of animals to get the number of saltwater animals:

Number of saltwater animals = Total number of animals - Number of freshwater animals

Number of saltwater animals = 2184 - (10 x 39)

Number of saltwater animals = 2184 - 390

Number of saltwater animals = 1794

Therefore, Tyler has 1794 saltwater animals. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1794.

First, we need to find out how many blocks Randy used in total. To do that, we can add the number of blocks he used to build the tower and the number of blocks he used to build the house:

14 + 11 = 25

So Randy used 25 blocks in total.

Next, we need to subtract the number of blocks Randy used from the total number of blocks he had to begin with:

Q: Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven who has 8 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 5 peaches. How many more peaches does Jake have than Jill?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Steven has 5 peaches. 

Next, we know that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, Jill must have 5 - 8 = -3 peaches. However, this doesn't make sense, so we need to adjust our understanding of the problem. 

Instead, let's say that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, who has some unknown number of peaches. So, we can write an equation: 

Steven's peaches = Jill's peaches + 8 

We also know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we can write another equation: 

Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 3 

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: 

Jake's peaches = (Jill's peaches + 8) - 3 

Simplifying, we get: 

Jake's peaches = Jill's peaches + 5 

We still don't know how many peaches Jill has, but we can use the information we have to find the difference between Jake's and Jill's peaches. 

If Steven has 5 peaches and 8 more than Jill, then Jill must have 5 - 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2 more peaches than Jake.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Rebecca has 12 eggs and wants to split them into groups of 20. We can see that 12 is less than 20, so she won't be able to make a full group of 20 eggs. Therefore, we need to find out how many groups of 20 eggs she can make and how many eggs will be left over.

To do this, we can divide 12 by 20 using long division. The quotient is 0 and the remainder is 12. This means that Rebecca can't make any full groups of 20 eggs and she has 12 eggs left over.

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Rebecca has than marbles. We know that she has 5 marbles, so we just need to subtract 5 from 12.

12 - 5 = 7

Therefore, Rebecca has 7 more eggs than marbles.

We know that Debby drank 109 bottles a day and the bottles lasted for 74 days. So, we can substitute these values into the formula:

number of bottles = 109 x 74

Now, we can use a calculator to solve this multiplication:

number of bottles = 8,066

First, we need to find out how many pages Frank read in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of pages in the book (112) by the number of days it took him to finish it (16):

Total pages read = 112 x 16
Total pages read = 1792

So Frank read a total of 1792 pages.

71 - x = number of books sold 

Next, we can add the number of new books he bought to the number he had after selling some: 

71 - x + 38 = 116 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

109 - x = 116 

Now we can solve for x: 

x = 7 

So Paul sold 7 books in the garage sale. 

To find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we can subtract the number of books sold from the number of new books bought: 

38 - 7 = 31 

Therefore, Paul bought 31 more books than he sold.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many crackers and cakes Matthew gave to each friend. Since he gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend, we can divide the total number of crackers and cakes by 2 to get the amount each friend received.

So, Matthew gave away a total of 29 + 30 = 59 snacks.

Dividing 59 by 2, we get 29.5. However, since we can't give half a snack, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each friend received 29 snacks.

Since each friend received an equal number of cakes and crackers, they each received 29/2 = 14.5 snacks of each type. Again, we need to round down to the nearest whole number, so each friend received 14 cakes.

Q: Josh had 3 marbles in his collection. He found 6 marbles while he lost 5 marbles. How many more marbles did he find than those he lost?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find out how many marbles Josh has after finding 6 and losing 5. 

Starting with his original 3 marbles, we can add the 6 he found: 

3 + 6 = 9 

Now we need to subtract the 5 he lost: 

9 - 5 = 4 

So Josh now has 4 marbles. 

To find out how many more marbles he found than those he lost, we can subtract the number of marbles he lost from the number he found: 

6 - 5 = 1 

Therefore, Josh found 1 more marble than he lost. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 2 chapters each with 405 pages. It took frank 664 days to finish the book. How many chapters did he read per day?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of pages in the book. Since there are 2 chapters and each chapter has 405 pages, the total number of pages in the book is:

2 x 405 = 810 pages

Next, we need to find how many chapters Frank read per day. To do this, we can divide the total number of chapters by the number of days it took him to finish the book:

2 / 664 = 0.00301204819 chapters per day

However, this answer is not very useful since it is difficult to read a fraction of a chapter per day. So, we can round this number to the nearest whole number to get a more practical answer:

0.00301204819 โ 0 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

Therefore, Frank read 0 chapters per day, which means he did not read any chapters at all. This answer seems unlikely, so we may need to check our calculations or assumptions. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 0 chapters per day.

Q: Dave had 15 apps on his phone. He added 71 new apps. After deleting some he had 14 left. How many more apps did he delete than he added?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can start by finding out how many apps Dave had in total after adding the new ones. We can do this by adding the number of apps he had originally to the number of new apps he added: 

15 + 71 = 86 

So Dave had 86 apps in total after adding the new ones. 

Next, we can figure out how many apps he deleted by subtracting the number of apps he had left from the total number of apps he had: 

86 - 14 = 72 

Therefore, Dave deleted 72 apps in total. 

Finally, to answer the question of how many more apps he deleted than he added, we can subtract the number of new apps he added from the number of apps he deleted: 

72 - 71 = 1 

So Dave deleted 1 more app than he added. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. We can do this by subtracting the total number of cards she has now from the total number of cards she had before giving some to Jeff:

309 + 356 = 665 (total cards before giving some to Jeff)
665 - (415 + x) = y (total cards left after giving some to Jeff, where x is the number of baseball cards Nell gave to Jeff and y is the total number of cards left)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

250 - x = y

Next, we need to set up another equation to represent the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has left:

415 - y = z (where z is the difference between the number of baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has left)

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for z:

415 - (250 - x) = z
165 + x = z

Therefore, Nell has x more baseball cards than Ace cards left. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is x = 165.

First, we need to find out how many pages the second chapter has:

Second chapter = 18 pages

Next, we need to find out how many pages the third chapter has:

Third chapter = 3 pages

Now, we can find the difference between the two:

18 - 3 = 15

Therefore, the second chapter has 15 more pages than the third chapter.

Q: Tiffany was collecting cans for recycling. On monday she had some bags of cans. The next day she found 4 more bags worth of cans. If she had a total of 8 bags altogether How many bags did she have on monday?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume that Tiffany had x bags of cans on Monday.

According to the problem, the next day she found 4 more bags worth of cans. So, the total number of bags she had on Tuesday would be x + 4.

And, we know that she had a total of 8 bags altogether. So, we can write an equation:

x + (x + 4) = 8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 4 = 8

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get:

2x = 4

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 2

Therefore, Tiffany had 2 bags of cans on Monday. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

Q: Frank was reading through some books. Each book had 66 pages and it took Frank 12 days to finish each book. If he takes 492 days to finish all books How many books did he read?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many pages Frank reads in a day. To do this, we can divide the number of pages in a book (66) by the number of days it takes him to finish it (12):

66 / 12 = 5.5

So Frank reads 5.5 pages per day. 

Next, we can use this information to figure out how many pages he reads in total. We know that he takes 492 days to finish all the books, so we can multiply the number of pages he reads per day by the number of days:

5.5 pages/day x 492 days = 2706 pages

Finally, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages in each book to find out how many books he read:

2706 pages / 66 pages per book = 41 books

Therefore, Frank read 41 books. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 41.

Q: 5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many children were on the bus before any got off or on. We know that there were 5 children on the bus to start with. 

Next, we need to subtract the number of children who got off the bus from the total number of children on the bus before any got on. We know that 63 children got off the bus, so we can subtract that from the original 5 children: 

5 - 63 = -58 

This means that there were -58 children on the bus after 63 got off. But this doesn't make sense, since we can't have negative children! 

So we need to think about what happened next. The problem tells us that some more children got on the bus after 63 got off. We don't know how many, but we do know that there were 14 children on the bus after everyone had gotten on and off. 

So we can set up an equation: 

5 - 63 + x = 14 

Here, x represents the number of children who got on the bus after 63 got off. We can solve for x by adding 63 to both sides of the equation: 

5 + x = 77 

Now we can solve for x 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is x = 72 

So 72 more children got on the bus than those that got off.

So 72 more children got on the bus than those that got off.

So there are 9 pairs of bananas in Philip's collection.

Next, we need to determine how many groups there are. Since each group contains 2 bananas, we can simply divide the total number of pairs by 2:

9 รท 2 = 4.5

However, we can't have half a group, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 5 groups of bananas in Philip's collection. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 5.

Q: Lewis earns $ 28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. He also earns $ 939 per week for working overtime. If he works overtime every week How much money does he earn during harvest season?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate Lewis's regular earnings during the harvest season. 

Regular earnings per week = $28 

Total regular earnings during harvest season = $28 x 1091 weeks = $30,548 

Next, we need to calculate Lewis's earnings from working overtime. 

Overtime earnings per week = $939 

Total overtime earnings during harvest season = $939 x 1091 weeks = $1,024,149 

Finally, we can calculate Lewis's total earnings during the harvest season by adding his regular earnings and overtime earnings. 

Total earnings during harvest season = $30,548 + $1,024,149 = $1,054,697 

Therefore, Lewis earns $1,054,697 during the harvest season if he works overtime every week.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Identify the total number of kids.
The total number of kids is the sum of those who went to camp and those who stayed home.
Total number of kids = 202958 + 777622 = 980580

Step 2: Calculate the difference between those who stayed home and those who went to camp.
To find out how many more kids stayed home compared to those who went to camp, we need to subtract the number of kids who went to camp from the total number of kids.
Difference = Total number of kids - Number of kids who went to camp
Difference = 980580 - 202958
Difference = 777622

Therefore, 777622 more kids stayed home compared to those who went to camp.

Number of girls = Number of boys + 402

We also know that there are 739 girls in the school, so we can substitute that into the equation:

739 = b + 402

Now we can solve for "b" by subtracting 402 from both sides of the equation:

739 - 402 = b

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many nails are needed for the large planks. We know that each large plank needs 14 pieces of nails, and John has 12 large planks. So the total number of nails needed for the large planks is:

14 x 12 = 168 nails

Next, we need to find out how many nails are needed for the small planks. We know that each small plank needs 25 nails, and John has 17 small planks. So the total number of nails needed for the small planks is:

25 x 17 = 425 nails

Now that we know how many nails are needed for each type of plank, we can add them together to find the total number of nails needed:

168 + 425 = 593 nails

Finally, we need to find out how many planks John needs in total. He has 12 large planks and 17 small planks, so the total number of planks is:

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches.

Next, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. We are told that the frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper. So, we can add 10 to 19 to get:

19 + 10 = 29

Therefore, the frog jumped 29 inches.

29 + 20 = 49

Therefore, the mouse jumped 49 inches.

Now, to answer the question, we need to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper. We can subtract the distance the grasshopper jumped from the distance the mouse jumped:

49 - 19 = 30

Therefore, the mouse jumped 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Edward spent in total. We can do this by adding the amount he spent on books and pens: 

$16 + $8 = $24 

So Edward spent $24 in total. 

Next, we need to figure out how much money he has left after spending that amount: 

$24 - $19 = $5 

So Edward has $5 left. 

Finally, we can answer the question by finding the difference between the amount he spent on books and pens:

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find the total number of tables and chairs they have in the backyard. 

We know they have 11 sets of tables, so that means they have 11 tables. 

Each set of tables has 13 chairs, so we can multiply 11 by 13 to find the total number of chairs: 

11 x 13 = 143 

Therefore, they have 143 chairs in their backyard. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 143.

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 2 more cups of flour How many cups of flour did she put in?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the recipe calls for 12 cups of flour and Mary needs 2 more cups of flour. So, in total, Mary needs 12 + 2 = 14 cups of flour.

Next, we know that Mary has already put in some cups of flour. Let's call the number of cups she has already put in "x".

So, the equation we can use to solve for "x" is:

x + 5 = 14

We add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate "x":

x = 9

Therefore, Mary has already put in 9 cups of flour. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches. 

Next, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. We know that the frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can add 32 to the grasshopper's jump: 

25 + 32 = 57 

Therefore, the frog jumped 57 inches. 

Finally, we need to find out how far the mouse jumped. We know that the mouse jumped 26 inches lesser than the frog, so we can subtract 26 from the frog's jump: 

57 - 26 = 31 

Therefore, the mouse jumped 31 inches. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 31 inches.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

Step 1: Find out how many sweet cookies Paco has left after eating 15 of them.
- Paco had 40 sweet cookies
- He ate 15 sweet cookies
- Therefore, he has 40 - 15 = 25 sweet cookies left

Step 2: Find out how many salty cookies Paco has left after eating 28 of them.
- Paco had 25 salty cookies
- He ate 28 salty cookies
- Therefore, he has 25 - 28 = -3 salty cookies left

Step 3: Determine how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies Paco ate.
- Paco ate 28 salty cookies and 15 sweet cookies
- He ate 28 - 15 = 13 more salty cookies than sweet cookies

Therefore, Paco ate 13 more salty cookies than sweet cookies.

Q: Baker made 19 cakes and 131 pastries. If he sold 70 cakes and 88 pastries How many more pastries than cakes did baker make?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cakes and pastries Baker has left after selling 70 cakes and 88 pastries. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of cakes and pastries sold from the total number of cakes and pastries Baker made: 

Number of cakes left = 19 - 70 = -51 
Number of pastries left = 131 - 88 = 43 

Uh oh, it looks like Baker sold more cakes than he made! We can assume that he had some leftover cakes from a previous batch or that there was a mistake in the problem. 

Now, to answer the question of how many more pastries than cakes Baker made, we can subtract the number of cakes from the number of pastries: 

Number of pastries - Number of cakes = 43 - 19 = 24 

Therefore, Baker made 24 more pastries than cakes. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 24.

Q: For the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used. How many planks does John need for the house wall?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can start by using algebra to represent the problem. Let's say that the number of planks needed is "x". 

We know that each plank needs 3 nails to be secured, so the total number of nails needed for "x" planks is 3x. 

We also know that an additional 8 nails were used, so the total number of nails used is 3x + 8. 

Finally, we know that the total number of nails used is 11. So we can set up an equation: 

3x + 8 = 11 

Solving for "x", we get: 

3x = 3 

x = 1 

Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost 17 of his marbles at the playground. How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many marbles Ed had before he lost 17. We know that Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, so we can set up an equation:

Ed's marbles = Doug's marbles + 29

Let's use "E" to represent Ed's marbles and "D" to represent Doug's marbles:

E = D + 29

Now we know that Ed lost 17 marbles, so we can subtract 17 from E:

E - 17 = (D + 29) - 17

Simplifying this equation, we get:

E - 17 = D + 12

Now we can solve for the difference between Ed's and Doug's marbles by subtracting D from both sides:

E - D - 17 = 12

Finally, we can simplify this equation to get our answer:

E - D = 29

So even after Ed lost 17 marbles, he still had 29 more marbles than Doug. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 29.

15 aquariums * 19 animals per aquarium = 285 animals in saltwater aquariums 

Next, we can find the total number of animals in the freshwater aquariums using the same method: 

62 aquariums * 19 animals per aquarium = 1178 animals in freshwater aquariums 

Finally, we can add the number of animals in the saltwater and freshwater aquariums to find the total number of animals: 

285 animals in saltwater aquariums + 1178 animals in freshwater aquariums = 1463 animals in total

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 192 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 34 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling t-shirts and jerseys. 

Revenue from t-shirts = 192 x 157 = 30,144 dollars 
Revenue from jerseys = 34 x 19 = 646 dollars 

Next, we can find the difference in revenue between the two: 

30,144 - 646 = 29,498 

This means that the Razorback shop made 29,498 dollars more from selling t-shirts than from selling jerseys. 

To answer the question, we can divide this difference by the number of t-shirts sold: 

29,498 / 157 = 187.57 

So a t-shirt costs 187.57 dollars more than a jersey.

We know that there are 7 red peaches and 71 yellow peaches, so we can add those together: 

7 + 71 = 78 

Now we can subtract the total number of peaches (78 + 8 = 86) from the number of green peaches: 

86 - 8 = 78 

So there are 78 green peaches in the basket. 

Finally, we can subtract the number of red peaches from the number of green peaches to find out how many more green peaches there are: 

78 - 7 = 71 

Therefore, there are 71 more green peaches than red peaches in the basket. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 71.

Q: Allan brought 2 balloons and Jake brought 4 balloons to the park. Allan then bought 3 more balloons at the park. How many more balloons did Allan have than Jake in the park?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many balloons Allan has in total after buying 3 more at the park. 

Allan had 2 balloons to start with, and then bought 3 more, so he now has 2 + 3 = 5 balloons. 

Jake brought 4 balloons to the park. 

To find out how many more balloons Allan has than Jake, we need to subtract the number of balloons Jake has from the number of balloons Allan has. 

So, Allan has 5 balloons and Jake has 4 balloons. 

Therefore, Allan has 5 - 4 = 1 more balloon than Jake in the park. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: A waiter had 3 customers. After some left he still had 4 customers. How many more customers stayed behind than those that left?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that the waiter had 3 customers initially. After some left, he still had 4 customers. So, we can assume that at least one customer left and the remaining 2 stayed behind.

To find out how many more customers stayed behind than those that left, we need to subtract the number of customers who left from the number of customers who stayed behind.

So, the number of customers who stayed behind is 4 (the total number of customers after some left) minus the number of customers who left (which we don't know yet).

Let's call the number of customers who left "x". Then, the number of customers who stayed behind is 4 - x.

To find out how many more customers stayed behind than those that left, we need to subtract x from 4 - x:

4 - x - x = 4 - 2x

So, the answer is 4 - 2x. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4 - 2x.

He added 11 new apps.
So, the total number of apps on his phone became 10 + 11 = 21.

After deleting some apps, he had 4 left.
So, the number of apps he deleted is 21 - 4 = 17.

Q: A book has 2 chapters across 81 pages. The second chapter is 68 pages long. How many pages are in the second chapter?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the book has 2 chapters across 81 pages. This means that each chapter takes up an equal amount of pages. 

To find out how many pages are in the second chapter, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters. 

81 pages / 2 chapters = 40.5 pages per chapter 

However, we know that the second chapter is 68 pages long. So we can simply state that the second chapter is 68 pages long. 

Therefore, the answer is: The second chapter is 68 pages long. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 68.

First, we need to find out how many more kids Julia played with on Tuesday than on Monday. To do this, we need to subtract the number of kids she played with on Monday from the number of kids she played with on Tuesday.

So, we can write:

12 - 11 = ?

Now, we just need to subtract 11 from 12:

12 - 11 = 1

Therefore, Julia played with 1 more kid on Tuesday than on Monday.

Q: There are 22 different books and 10 different movies in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 12 of the books and watched 56 of the movies How many more books do you still have to read?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books and movies there are in total. We can do this by adding the number of books and movies together:

22 books + 10 movies = 32 items in total

Next, we need to subtract the number of books and movies that have already been read and watched:

12 books + 56 movies = 68 items already read/watched

To find out how many more books need to be read, we can subtract the number of items already read/watched from the total number of items:

32 total items - 68 items already read/watched = -36

This means that there are actually 36 more items that need to be read/watched in order to complete the entire series. However, since we are only looking for the number of books that still need to be read, we can subtract the number of books already read from the total number of books:

22 total books - 12 books already read = 10 books still need to be read

Therefore, there are still 10 more books that need to be read in the 'crazy silly school' series. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 10.

First, we need to find out how many blocks Randy used in total. To do that, we can add the number of blocks he used to build the house and the number of blocks he used to build the tower:

20 + 50 = 70

So Randy used 70 blocks in total.

Next, we need to find out how many more blocks he used to build the tower than he did to build the house. To do that, we can subtract the number of blocks he used to build the house from the number of blocks he used to build the tower:

50 - 20 = 30

So Randy used 30 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.

Ryan spends 4 hours on learning English and 5 hours on learning Chinese every day. 

Next, we need to find out how many hours Ryan spends on learning English and Chinese in total. 

To do this, we can multiply the number of hours Ryan spends on learning English and Chinese each day by the number of days he learns. 

So, Ryan spends a total of:

4 hours/day x 7 days = 28 hours on learning English 

5 hours/day x 7 days = 35 hours on learning Chinese

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to figure out how many bottle caps Danny had before he threw away the old ones and found the new ones. 

We can start by setting up an equation: 

x - 60 + 58 = 67 

Here, x represents the original number of bottle caps Danny had. We subtract 60 because he threw away that many, and add 58 because he found that many new ones. The result should be equal to the current total of 67. 

Now we can solve for x: 

x - 2 = 67 

x = 69 

Therefore, Danny had 69 bottle caps at first. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 69.

Let's try a different approach. We know that Paul had 51 books and 106 pens to start with. After the garage sale, he had 82 books and 14 pens left. So he must have sold:

Books sold = 51 - 82 = 31
Pens sold = 106 - 14 = 92

Step 4: Then, some more children got on the bus, and the total number of children on the bus became 12.
Step 5: To find out how many more children got off the bus than those that got on, we need to subtract the number of children on the bus after some more got on from the number of children that got off the bus. So, 68 - 12 = 56.

Q: Jerry had 2 action figures and 10 books on a shelf in his room. Later he added 4 more action figures to the shelf. How many more books than action figures were on his shelf?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many items were on the shelf before Jerry added the 4 action figures. We know he had 2 action figures and 10 books, so:

2 action figures + 10 books = 12 items

Next, we need to add the 4 action figures that Jerry added:

12 items + 4 action figures = 16 items

Now we know that there are 16 items on the shelf. We also know that there are 4 action figures on the shelf. To find out how many more books than action figures are on the shelf, we need to subtract the number of action figures from the total number of items:

16 items - 4 action figures = 12 books

So there are 12 more books than action figures on the shelf. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12.

Q: In a school there are 868 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 281 more girls than boys How many pupils are there in that school?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent the problem. Let's call the total number of pupils in the school "x" and the number of boys "b". 

We know that there are 868 girls, so the number of boys can be found by subtracting 868 from the total number of pupils: 

b = x - 868 

We also know that there are 281 more girls than boys: 

868 = b + 281 

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation: 

868 = (x - 868) + 281 

Simplifying this equation: 

868 = x - 587 

Adding 587 to both sides: 

x = 1455 

Therefore, there are 1455 pupils in the school. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1455.

Q: The Razorback shop makes $ 67 dollars off each t-shirt and $ 165 off each jersey. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 74 t-shirts and 156 jerseys. How much money did they make from selling the jerseys?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from selling jerseys. To do this, we need to multiply the number of jerseys sold by the profit made on each jersey. 

Profit made on each jersey = $165
Number of jerseys sold = 156

Total revenue generated from selling jerseys = Profit made on each jersey x Number of jerseys sold
Total revenue generated from selling jerseys = $165 x 156
Total revenue generated from selling jerseys = $25,740

Therefore, the Razorback shop made $25,740 from selling jerseys during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $25,740.

Baker made 133 cakes.
He sold 51 of them.

To find out how many more cakes Baker made than those he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he made.

So, the calculation would be:

133 - 51 = 82

Therefore, Baker made 82 more cakes than those he sold. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 82.

We know that Haley grew some trees in her backyard. Let's call the total number of trees she grew "x".

After a typhoon, 5 trees died. So, the number of trees left would be "x - 5".

We also know that there were 12 trees left after the typhoon. So, we can set up an equation:

x - 5 = 12

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

x - 5 + 5 = 12 + 5

Simplifying:

x = 17

Therefore, Haley grew 17 trees in her backyard. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 17.

Q: Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 36 of the pickers that they fill 8 drums of grapes per day. How many days will it take to fill 240 drums of grapes?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many drums of grapes are filled in one day by 36 pickers. We can do this by multiplying the number of pickers by the number of drums filled per day: 

36 pickers x 8 drums/day = 288 drums/day 

So, 36 pickers can fill 288 drums of grapes in one day. 

Next, we need to figure out how many days it will take to fill 240 drums of grapes. We can do this by dividing the total number of drums by the number of drums filled per day: 

240 drums รท 288 drums/day = 0.8333... days 

Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole day. Therefore, it will take 1 day to fill 240 drums of grapes with 36 pickers filling 8 drums per day. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1 day.

First, we need to find the total number of pages in the book. To do that, we can add up the number of pages in each chapter. 

So, 

Total number of pages = Number of pages in chapter 1 + Number of pages in chapter 2 + Number of pages in chapter 3 

= 66 + 35 + 24 

= 125 

Therefore, the book has 125 pages altogether.

2 + 4 = 6

There were 6 roses in the vase before Jessica added more.

Now we need to figure out how many roses Jessica added. We know there are now 23 roses in the vase, so:

23 - 6 = 17

Jessica added 17 roses to the vase.

Therefore, Jessica cut 17 roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.

Q: Frank was reading through his favorite book. He read 8 pages per day. If the book had 576 pages How many days did he take to finish the book?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we need to find out how many pages Frank reads in total. To do this, we can use the formula:

Total pages read = pages read per day x number of days

So, in this case, we have:

Total pages read = 8 x number of days

Next, we need to find out how many days it takes Frank to finish the book. To do this, we can rearrange the formula above to solve for the number of days:

Number of days = Total pages read / pages read per day

So, in this case, we have:

Number of days = 576 / 8

Simplifying this, we get:

Number of days = 72

Therefore, Frank took 72 days to finish the book. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 72.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

First, we need to find out how many chairs they currently have. We know that they have 4 sets of tables, and each set has 3 chairs. So, the total number of chairs they currently have is:

4 sets x 3 chairs per set = 12 chairs

Next, we need to figure out how many chairs they will need for the 14 people attending the party. Since each set of tables has 3 chairs, we can divide the total number of people by 3 to find out how many sets of tables they will need:

14 people / 3 chairs per set = 4.67 sets of tables

Since they can't have a fraction of a set of tables, they will need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, they will need 5 sets of tables.

Finally, we can calculate how many more chairs they will need to buy by subtracting the number of chairs they currently have from the total number of chairs they will need:

5 sets x 3 chairs per set - 12 chairs = 3 chairs

Therefore, they will need to buy 3 more chairs for the party. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

We know that Jack received 4 emails in the morning. 

Let's represent the number of emails he received in the afternoon with a variable, say "x". 

So, the total number of emails he received in the day is 4 + x. 

We also know that the total number of emails he received in the day is 5. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

4 + x = 5 

Now we can solve for x: 

x = 5 - 4 

x = 1

7 cups of flour - 2 cups of flour = 5 cups of flour

So Mary still needs to add 5 cups of flour.

Next, we need to find out how many more cups of flour than cups of salt she needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount of salt required from the amount of flour required, and then subtract the amount of salt she has already added:

7 cups of flour - 4 cups of salt = 3 cups more flour than salt required

3 cups more flour than salt required - 2 cups of flour already added = 1 cup more flour than salt she needs to add now

Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour than cups of salt.

Out of these 16 peaches, 13 are red. 

So, we can subtract 13 from 16 to find out how many green peaches are in the basket. 

16 - 13 = 3 

Therefore, there are 3 green peaches in the basket. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 5. Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles. How many more eggs does Rebecca have than marbles?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many groups of 5 eggs Rebecca can make with her 20 eggs. 

To do this, we can divide 20 by 5: 

20 รท 5 = 4 

So Rebecca can make 4 groups of 5 eggs. 

Now we need to figure out how many eggs she has left over. 

To do this, we can multiply the number of groups she made by 5, and then subtract that from the total number of eggs she had: 

4 x 5 = 20 

20 - 20 = 0 

So Rebecca has 0 eggs left over. 

Finally, we need to figure out how many more eggs she has than marbles. 

Rebecca has 20 eggs and 6 marbles, so we can subtract: 

20 - 6 = 14 

Therefore, Rebecca has 14 more eggs than marbles. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

Next, we are told that 3 more birds come to join them. So now the total number of birds on the fence is:

2 + 3 = 5

To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we need to subtract the number of birds from the number of storks:

6 - 5 = 1

Therefore, there is 1 more stork than bird sitting on the fence. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms. 

After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 101 kilograms. 

We need to find out how much she weighed before starting to jog. 

To do this, we can use subtraction. 

We can subtract the weight she lost from her current weight to find her previous weight. 

So, her previous weight would be:

Previous weight = Current weight + Weight lost
Previous weight = 27 + 101
Previous weight = 128 kilograms

Therefore, Jessie weighed 128 kilograms before starting to jog. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 128.

Q: After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace on average per day over the past 327 days. We can do this by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days:

406 visitors / 327 days = 1.24 visitors per day (rounded to two decimal places)

Next, we can use this average to estimate how many visitors came to the palace on the previous day. We can assume that the number of visitors per day is roughly constant, so we can use the average to make an educated guess:

1.24 visitors per day x 1 day = 1.24 visitors

However, since we know that 132 visitors came to the palace on the day in question, we can adjust our estimate accordingly:

132 visitors - 1.24 visitors = 130.76 visitors

Therefore, we can estimate that approximately 130 visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 130.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total amount of money Edward spent on books and pens. We can do this by adding the amount he spent on books and the amount he spent on pens: 

$6 + $16 = $22 

So, Edward spent $22 in total. 

Now, we need to find out how much money Edward had before he spent his money. We can do this by subtracting the amount he spent from the amount he has now: 

$19 - $22 = -$3 

Uh oh, this answer doesn't make sense! It means that Edward had negative money before he spent his money, which is impossible. 

So, there must be a mistake somewhere. Let's check our calculations: 

$6 + $16 = $22 

$22 + $19 = $41 

Ah, there we go! We made a mistake in the second step. We need to add the amount Edward spent to the amount he has now to find out how much he had before he spent his money. 

Therefore, Edward had $41 before he spent his money. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 41.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of crayons that Paul had at the beginning of the school year. We know that he got a box of 65 crayons for his birthday, so that's our starting point.

Total number of crayons at the beginning = 65

Next, we need to subtract the number of crayons that Paul gave away to his friends during the school year. We know that he gave away 213 crayons, so we subtract that from the total number of crayons at the beginning.

Total number of crayons after giving away = 65 - 213 = -148

Uh oh, we have a problem here. We can't have a negative number of crayons. This means that our calculation is incorrect. 

Let's try again. This time, we'll subtract the number of crayons that Paul lost instead of giving away.

Total number of crayons after losing = 65 - 16 = 49

Now we have a positive number, which means that our calculation is correct. Therefore, Paul had lost or given away 213 + 16 = 229 crayons.

Q: Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of crackers and cakes that Matthew gave to his 28 friends. Since he gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend, we can assume that each friend received x crackers and x cakes.

So, the total number of crackers and cakes that Matthew gave to his friends is:

Total crackers = 28 * x
Total cakes = 28 * x

Since Matthew initially had 13 crackers and 15 cakes, we can set up an equation:

Total crackers = Initial crackers - crackers eaten
Total cakes = Initial cakes - cakes eaten

Substituting the values, we get:

28 * x = 13 - crackers eaten
28 * x = 15 - cakes eaten

Simplifying the equations, we get:

crackers eaten = 13 - 28 * x
cakes eaten = 15 - 28 * x

Since each friend received an equal number of crackers and cakes, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

13 - 28 * x = 15 - 28 * x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1

Therefore, each person ate 1 cracker and 1 cake. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1 cracker and 1 cake per person.

Q: Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 letters in the morning. He then received 6 emails and sent 8 letters in the afternoon. How many emails did Jack send in the day?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

In the morning, Jack received 4 emails and sent 2 letters. So, the total number of emails he sent in the morning is 0 (since he didn't send any emails) and the total number of letters he sent in the morning is 2.

In the afternoon, Jack received 6 emails and sent 8 letters. So, the total number of emails he sent in the afternoon is 6 and the total number of letters he sent in the afternoon is 8.

To find the total number of emails Jack sent in the day, we just need to add the number of emails he sent in the morning and the number of emails he sent in the afternoon. 

Therefore, the total number of emails Jack sent in the day is 0 + 6 = 6. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

Q: A waiter had some customers. After 9 customers left he still had 12 customers. How many customers did he have at the start?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

Let's say the waiter had "x" customers at the start. 

After 9 customers left, he still had 12 customers. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

x - 9 = 12 

To solve for x, we can add 9 to both sides: 

x - 9 + 9 = 12 + 9 

Simplifying: 

x = 21

Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvested 56 sacks of oranges. How many sacks did they harvest per day if they harvested for a total of 14 days?
A: Let's think step by step. We can start by using the formula:

Total amount = rate x time

In this case, the total amount of sacks harvested is 56, and the time is 14 days. We need to find the rate (or amount per day) at which they harvested the oranges.

So, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the rate:

Rate = Total amount / time

Plugging in the values we have:

Rate = 56 sacks / 14 days

Simplifying:

Rate = 4 sacks per day

Therefore, they harvested 4 sacks of oranges per day. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4 sacks per day.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Olivia had after collecting 91 dollars from the ATM. We can do this by adding the amount she had in her wallet to the amount she collected from the ATM: 

53 + 91 = 144 

So Olivia had 144 dollars after collecting money from the ATM. 

Next, we need to find out how much money Olivia spent at the supermarket. We can do this by subtracting the amount she had left from the amount she had after collecting money from the ATM: 

144 - 14 = 130 

So Olivia spent 130 dollars at the supermarket. 

Finally, we need to find out how much more money Olivia spent at the supermarket than she collected from the ATM. We can do this by subtracting the amount she collected from the ATM from the amount she spent at the supermarket: 

130 - 91 = 39 

So Olivia spent 39 dollars more at the supermarket than she collected from the ATM.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many Sony games Kelly currently has. We can do this by subtracting the number of Nintendo games from the total number of games she has:

Total number of games = 46 Nintendo games + 132 Sony games = 178 games

So Kelly currently has 132 Sony games.

Next, we need to figure out how many Sony games she needs to give away to have 31 left. We can set up an equation to solve for this:

132 - x = 31

where x is the number of Sony games she needs to give away.

To solve for x, we can subtract 132 from both sides of the equation:

-x = 31 - 132

Simplifying:

-x = -101

Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by -1:

x = 101

So Kelly needs to give away 101 Sony games in order to have 31 left.

Q: During the Arkansas and Texas tech game the Razorback t-shirt shop made $ 60 by selling t-shirts. If they make $ 10 dollars off each t-shirt sold How many t-shirts did they sell?
A: Let's think step by step. We know that the Razorback t-shirt shop made $60 by selling t-shirts and they make $10 off each t-shirt sold. 

To find out how many t-shirts they sold, we can divide the total revenue by the revenue per t-shirt: 

Number of t-shirts sold = Total revenue / Revenue per t-shirt 

Number of t-shirts sold = $60 / $10 

Number of t-shirts sold = 6 

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop sold 6 t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6.

Q: Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 19 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 231 raisin cookies and 237 chocolate chip cookies this morning. How many more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cakes did Helen bake?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of chocolate chip cookies that Helen baked. We know that she baked 19 chocolate chip cookies yesterday and 237 chocolate chip cookies this morning. So, the total number of chocolate chip cookies she baked is:

19 + 237 = 256

Next, we need to find the total number of raisin cookies that Helen baked. We know that she baked 231 raisin cookies this morning. So, the total number of raisin cookies she baked is:

231

Now, we can find the difference between the number of chocolate chip cookies and raisin cookies that Helen baked. To do this, we can subtract the number of raisin cookies from the number of chocolate chip cookies:

256 - 231 = 25

Therefore, Helen baked 25 more chocolate chip cookies than raisin cookies. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 25.

Q: Paco had 41 cookies. He gave 9 cookies to his friend and ate 18 cookies. How many more cookies did he eat than those he gave to his friend?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

Step 1: Start with the total number of cookies Paco had, which is 41.

Step 2: Subtract the number of cookies he gave to his friend, which is 9. This leaves him with 32 cookies.

Step 3: Subtract the number of cookies he ate, which is 18. This leaves him with 14 cookies.

Step 4: To find out how many more cookies he ate than those he gave to his friend, subtract the number of cookies he gave to his friend from the number of cookies he ate. 

So, 18 - 9 = 9. Paco ate 9 more cookies than those he gave to his friend. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

Q: Bryan took a look at his books as well. If he has 34 books distributed equally in 2 bookshelves How many books are there in each bookshelf?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of books. We can do this by adding the number of books in each bookshelf. 

Total number of books = 34 

Since the books are distributed equally in 2 bookshelves, we can divide the total number of books by 2 to find the number of books in each bookshelf. 

Number of books in each bookshelf = Total number of books / Number of bookshelves 

Number of books in each bookshelf = 34 / 2 

Number of books in each bookshelf = 17 

Therefore, there are 17 books in each bookshelf. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 17.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Jessie weighed 114 kilograms before she started jogging.

In the first week, she lost 50 kilograms. So her weight after the first week would be:

114 - 50 = 64 kilograms

In the second week, she lost another 60 kilograms. So her weight after the second week would be:

64 - 60 = 4 kilograms

Therefore, Jessie weighs 4 kilograms now.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that they harvest 8 sacks per day. 

We need to find out how many days it will take to harvest 24 sacks of oranges. 

To do this, we can use a simple formula: 

Number of days = Total number of sacks / Sacks harvested per day 

So, in this case: 

Number of days = 24 / 8 

Number of days = 3 

Therefore, it will take 3 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges.

First, we need to find the total number of soda bottles. We can do this by adding the number of regular soda bottles and the number of diet soda bottles:

72 + 32 = 104

So, the grocery store had 104 soda bottles in total.

Next, we need to find the difference between the number of soda bottles and the number of apples. We can do this by subtracting the number of apples from the total number of soda bottles:

104 - 78 = 26

Therefore, the grocery store had 26 more soda bottles than apples. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 26.

Q: Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. He ate some pieces of candy. Then he ate 5 more. If he still has 8 pieces of candy left How many pieces of candy had he eaten at the start?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. 

Next, we know that he ate some pieces of candy, but we don't know how many. Let's call this number "x". 

So after eating "x" pieces of candy, he had 22 - x pieces left. 

Then he ate 5 more pieces of candy, so he had 22 - x - 5 pieces left. 

And we know that he still had 8 pieces of candy left, so we can set up an equation: 

22 - x - 5 = 8 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

17 - x = 8 

Adding x to both sides, we get: 

17 = 8 + x 

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get: 

9 = x 

So Bobby had eaten 9 pieces of candy at the start. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

Q: There are 466 pots. Each pot has 53 flowers and 181 sticks in it. How many flowers and sticks are there in all?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

First, we need to find the total number of flowers. To do this, we can multiply the number of pots (466) by the number of flowers in each pot (53):

466 x 53 = 24,698

So there are 24,698 flowers in total.

Next, we need to find the total number of sticks. Again, we can multiply the number of pots (466) by the number of sticks in each pot (181):

466 x 181 = 84,146

So there are 84,146 sticks in total.

Therefore, the total number of flowers and sticks is:

24,698 + 84,146 = 108,844

So there are 108,844 flowers and sticks in total. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 108,844.

Next, we know that David did 9 more push-ups than Zachary. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

Zachary's push-ups + 9 = David's push-ups 

We can substitute in 44 for David's push-ups: 

Zachary's push-ups + 9 = 44 

Now we can solve for Zachary's push-ups: 

Zachary's push-ups = 44 - 9 

Zachary's push-ups = 35 

Therefore, Zachary did 35 push-ups in gym class today. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 35.

14 cups - 11 cups = 3 cups

So Mary still needs to add 3 cups of flour.

Next, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour she needs to add. To do this, we can subtract the amount of flour she needs to add from the amount of sugar required by the recipe:

5 cups - 3 cups = 2 cups

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bird families are left near the mountain. We can do this by subtracting the number of bird families that flew away from the total number of bird families near the mountain:

41 - 35 - 62 = -56

Wait a minute, we can't have negative bird families! This means there must be an error in the problem. Perhaps the number of bird families that flew away to Africa was supposed to be 27 instead of 62. Let's try that:

Q: Matthew had 31 crackers. He has 23 crackers left after he gave equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends. How many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many crackers Matthew gave to each of his 5 friends. To do this, we can divide the total number of crackers he had initially (31) by the number of friends he gave crackers to (5):

31 / 5 = 6.2

Since we can't give a fraction of a cracker, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Matthew gave each of his friends 6 crackers.

Next, we need to find out how many crackers Matthew gave away in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of crackers he gave to each friend (6) by the number of friends he gave crackers to (5):

6 x 5 = 30

So Matthew gave away a total of 30 crackers.

Finally, we can find out how many crackers he has left by subtracting the number of crackers he gave away (30) from the number he had initially (31):

31 - 30 = 1

Therefore, Matthew gave away 30 crackers to his friends. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 6 crackers.

We know that there are 10 sets of tables, and each set has 6 chairs. So, the total number of chairs is:

10 sets x 6 chairs per set = 60 chairs

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are occupied. 

We know that there are 11 people sitting on chairs. Since each person sits on one chair, the number of chairs occupied is:

11 chairs

Finally, we can find out how many chairs are left unoccupied by subtracting the number of chairs occupied from the total number of chairs:

60 chairs - 11 chairs = 49 chairs

Therefore, there are 49 chairs left unoccupied. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 49.

Next, we know that he removed some of the old ones, but we don't know how many. Let's call the number of action figures he removed "x".

So, if he had 7 action figures on the shelf and removed "x" of them, he would be left with 6 action figures. We can write this as an equation:

7 - x = 6

Now we can solve for "x":

7 - x = 6

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much strawberries Marco collected before his dad found the additional 30 pounds. We can do this by subtracting the weight of his dad's strawberries from the total weight they collected: 

22 pounds - x = weight of Marco's strawberries 

Next, we know that after his dad found the additional 30 pounds, Marco's strawberries weighed 36 pounds. So we can set up another equation: 

(22 - x) + 30 = 36 

Simplifying this equation: 

52 - x = 36 

Subtracting 52 from both sides: 

-x = -16 

Dividing both sides by -1: 

x = 16 

So Marco collected 16 pounds of strawberries before his dad found the additional 30 pounds. 

Now we can find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed: 

22 - 16 + dad's strawberries = 30 

Simplifying: 

6 + dad's strawberries = 30 

Subtracting 6 from both sides: 

dad's strawberries = 24 

Therefore, his dad's strawberries weighed 24 pounds.

So the machine made 17 shirts in total.

Next, we need to find out how long it took the machine to make those 17 shirts. We know that the machine can make 2 shirts a minute, so we can use division to find out how many minutes it took:

17 / 2 = 8.5

So it took the machine 8.5 minutes to make the 17 shirts.

However, the problem specifically asks how many minutes the machine worked today. We know that the machine made 8 shirts today, so we can use division again to find out how long it took to make those 8 shirts:

8 / 2 = 4

So the machine worked for 4 minutes today to make the 8 shirts.

We know that the mailman has to give 9 pieces of junk mail to each house in each block, and there are 20 houses on a block. So, to find out how many pieces of junk mail he should give in each block, we need to multiply the number of houses by the number of pieces of junk mail per house.

So, the calculation would be:

20 houses x 9 pieces of junk mail per house = 180 pieces of junk mail per block

Therefore, the mailman should give 180 pieces of junk mail in each block. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 180.

Q: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 66 sacks per day. How many oranges do they harvest per day if each sack contains 28 oranges?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many oranges are in one sack. We know that each sack contains 28 oranges.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges are harvested per day. We know that they harvest 66 sacks per day.

To find out how many oranges are harvested per day, we can multiply the number of sacks by the number of oranges in each sack:

66 sacks/day x 28 oranges/sack = 1848 oranges/day

Therefore, they harvest 1848 oranges per day. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1848.

Q: There are 4502 skittles in Steven's skittles collection. Steven also has 4276 erasers. If the skittles and erasers are organized into 154 groups How big is each group?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of items that Steven has. We can do this by adding the number of skittles and erasers:

4502 + 4276 = 8778

So Steven has a total of 8778 items.

Next, we need to divide the total number of items by the number of groups:

8778 รท 154 = 57.064935

This gives us a decimal answer, but we can't have a fraction of an item in a group. So we need to round our answer to the nearest whole number. Since we can't have a fraction of a group either, we'll round up if the decimal is 0.5 or greater, and round down if it's less than 0.5.

In this case, the decimal is 0.064935, which is less than 0.5. So we'll round down to 57.

Therefore, each group will have 57 items (skittles and erasers combined). 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 57.

Q: Baker made 126 cakes and 48 pastries. If he sold 115 cakes and 81 pastries How many more cakes than pastries did baker make?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cakes and pastries Baker has left after selling some of them. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of cakes and pastries sold from the total number of cakes and pastries made: 

Cakes left = 126 - 115 = 11 
Pastries left = 48 - 81 = -33 

Uh oh, it looks like we have a problem. We can't have negative pastries left! This means there must be a mistake in the problem. 

Perhaps the number of pastries sold was supposed to be 38 instead of 81? Let's try that: 

Cakes left = 126 - 115 = 11 
Pastries left = 48 - 38 = 10 

Now we have a valid answer. To find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker made, we can subtract the number of pastries from the number of cakes: 

Cakes - pastries = 11 - 10 = 1 

Therefore, Baker made 1 more cake than pastry. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: In Haley's class 11 are boys who love to play marbles. If Haley gives 9 marbles to each boy How many marbles did she have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many boys there are in Haley's class who love to play marbles. We know that there are 11 boys who love to play marbles.

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Haley gave to each boy. We know that she gave 9 marbles to each boy.

To find out how many marbles Haley had in total, we need to multiply the number of boys by the number of marbles she gave to each boy. So, we can use the following equation:

Total marbles = Number of boys x Marbles per boy

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

Total marbles = 11 x 9

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Total marbles = 99

Therefore, Haley had 99 marbles in total before she gave 9 marbles to each of the 11 boys in her class who love to play marbles.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that the waiter had 11 customers initially. After some left, he still had 3 customers. So, we can say that some customers left and some stayed behind.

Let's represent the number of customers who left as "x". Then, the number of customers who stayed behind would be 11 - x.

Now, we need to find out how many more customers left than those who stayed behind. To do this, we can subtract the number of customers who stayed behind from the number of customers who left.

So, the answer would be:

x - (11 - x) = 2x - 11

Therefore, the number of customers who left than those who stayed behind is 2x - 11. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2x - 11. However, we don't know the value of "x" yet, so we cannot give a specific numerical answer.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many sacks of oranges are harvested in 51 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of days:

74 sacks/day x 51 days = 3774 sacks

Next, we need to find out how many sacks are discarded in 51 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of sacks discarded per day by the number of days:

71 sacks/day x 51 days = 3621 sacks

Finally, we can subtract the number of discarded sacks from the total number of harvested sacks to find the number of sacks they will have after 51 days:

3774 sacks - 3621 sacks = 153 sacks

Therefore, they will have 153 sacks of oranges after 51 days of harvest.

We also know that by the end of the school year, he only had 291 crayons left. This means that he started with x crayons and lost/gave away (x - 291) crayons.

The problem tells us that he lost/gave away 315 crayons in total. So we can set up an equation:

x - 291 = 315

To solve for x, we can add 291 to both sides:

x = 606

Therefore, Paul got 606 crayons for his birthday. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 606.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of kids Julia played tag with on both days. We can do this by adding the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday: 

19 + 18 = 37 

So, Julia played tag with a total of 37 kids. 

Next, we know that she spent a total of 38 hours playing tag on both days. We don't know how many hours she spent on each day, but we can set up an equation to represent the total time: 

Time on Monday + Time on Tuesday = 38 

Let's use the variable "m" to represent the time she spent on Monday, and "t" to represent the time she spent on Tuesday: 

m + t = 38 

Now we need another equation to help us solve for the number of kids she played with on each day. We know that she played with 19 kids on Monday and 18 kids on Tuesday, so we can set up an equation to represent that: 

Number of kids on Monday - Number of kids on Tuesday = ? 

We don't know the answer yet, but we can use algebra to solve for it. Let's use the variable "k" to represent the difference in the number of kids: 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1. 

Now we can set up an equation using the information we have: 

19 - 18 = k 

Simplifying, we get:

1218 feet - 849 feet = 369 feet

So they still need to travel 369 feet to reach the end of the cave.

Next, we need to figure out how long it will take them to travel this distance at a speed of 17 feet per second. We can use the formula:

distance = speed x time

Rearranging this formula to solve for time, we get:

time = distance / speed

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

time = 369 feet / 17 feet per second

time โ 21.7 seconds

So it will take them approximately 21.7 seconds to travel the remaining 369 feet to reach the end of the cave.

177 tomatoes - 53 tomatoes = 124 tomatoes 

So the farmer has 124 tomatoes left. 

Next, we need to subtract the number of potatoes from the original total. 

177 tomatoes + 12 potatoes = 189 total plants 

Then, we subtract the number of potatoes left after the tomatoes were picked. 

189 total plants - 12 potatoes = 177 plants left 

Therefore, the farmer has 124 tomatoes and 177 plants (including the remaining tomatoes and potatoes) left in his garden.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

We can start by using the formula for finding the average or mean of a set of numbers. The formula is:

average = sum of numbers / number of numbers

In this case, the sum of the points Melissa scored in all 13 games is 91. So we can write:

average = 91 / 13

Simplifying this expression, we get:

average = 7

So the average number of points Melissa scored in each game is 7.

Since Melissa scored the same number of points in each game, we can say that she scored 7 points in each game. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

Q: The Ferris wheel in paradise park has 4 seats. If 20 people can ride the wheel at the same time How many people can each seat hold?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of seats on the Ferris wheel. We know that there are 4 seats per ride, so we can use division to find the total number of seats:

Total number of seats = 20 people / 4 seats per ride
Total number of seats = 5 rides

So, the Ferris wheel has a total of 5 rides.

Next, we can use division again to find out how many people each seat can hold:

Number of people per seat = 20 people / 5 rides / 4 seats per ride

Q: At the zoo, a cage had 95 snakes and 61 alligators. If 64 snakes were hiding How many snakes were not hiding?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many snakes were there in total before some of them started hiding. We know that there were 95 snakes in the cage, so:

Total number of snakes = 95

Next, we need to subtract the number of snakes that were hiding (64) from the total number of snakes to find out how many were not hiding:

Number of snakes not hiding = Total number of snakes - Number of snakes hiding
Number of snakes not hiding = 95 - 64
Number of snakes not hiding = 31

Therefore, there were 31 snakes that were not hiding. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 31.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many cookies Brenda's mother had left after throwing away 17 cookies. 

To do this, we can subtract 17 from 22: 

22 - 17 = 5 

So Brenda's mother had 5 cookies left. 

Next, we need to divide the 5 cookies equally among the 5 people: 

5 รท 5 = 1 

Therefore, each person would have 1 cookie. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: Paul had 2 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 150 new ones. If he has 58 books now How many books did he sell?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Paul had 2 books. Then he sold some books in a garage sale. Let's say he sold x books. 

So, after the garage sale, he had 2 - x books left. 

Next, he bought 150 new books. So, he now has 2 - x + 150 books. 

Finally, we know that he currently has 58 books. So, we can set up an equation: 

2 - x + 150 = 58 

Simplifying this equation: 

152 - x = 58 

Subtracting 152 from both sides: 

-x = -94 

Dividing both sides by -1: 

x = 94 

Therefore, Paul sold 94 books in the garage sale. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 94.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to calculate the new price of each t-shirt after the increase:

$201 + $217 = $418

So, each t-shirt was sold for $418 during the game.

Next, we need to multiply the price per t-shirt by the number of t-shirts sold:

$418 x 14 = $5852

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $5852 from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.

Paul had 21 books + 42 new ones = 63 books 

Next, we need to find out how many books Paul sold. 

Paul sold 63 books - 15 books he has now = 48 books 

Finally, we need to find out how many more books Paul sold than he bought. 

Paul sold 48 books - 42 new ones he bought = 6 more books sold than bought. 

Therefore, Paul sold 6 more books than he bought.

Q: Together Adam and Jackie have 6 apples. He has 4 apples more than adam and jackie together do. How many apples does he have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent the problem. Let's say Adam has x apples and Jackie has y apples. 

We know that together they have 6 apples, so we can write an equation: 

x + y = 6 

We also know that he has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so we can write another equation: 

x + y + 4 = number of apples he has 

Now we can use the first equation to solve for one of the variables. Let's solve for y: 

y = 6 - x 

We can substitute this expression for y into the second equation: 

x + (6 - x) + 4 = number of apples he has 

Simplifying: 

10 - x = number of apples he has 

So he has 10 - x apples. 

But we don't know what x is yet. We can use the first equation again to solve for x: 

x + y = 6 

x + (6 - x) = 6 

6 = 6 

This equation is true, which means any value of x that satisfies the first equation will work. Let's say x = 3. Then y = 6 - x = 3. 

 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is He has 11 apples.

Q: 2 birds were sitting on the fence. 5 more birds and 4 more storks came to join them. How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

First, we know that there were 2 birds sitting on the fence.

Then, 5 more birds came to join them, so now there are 2 + 5 = 7 birds on the fence.

Next, 4 more storks came to join them, but we don't know how many storks were already on the fence. So let's call the number of storks on the fence "s".

Now we can write an equation to represent the situation:

7 = s + 4

We can solve for s by subtracting 4 from both sides:

s = 7 - 4

s = 3

So there are 3 storks on the fence.

Finally, we can answer the question: How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?

We know there are 7 birds and 3 storks, so the difference is:

7 - 3 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 more birds than storks sitting on the fence. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

In the morning, Jack received 10 emails and 12 letters. So, the total number of emails and letters he received in the morning is:

10 + 12 = 22

In the afternoon, Jack received 3 emails and 44 letters. So, the total number of emails and letters he received in the afternoon is:

3 + 44 = 47

To find out how many more emails Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning:

10 - 3 = 7

Therefore, Jack received 7 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.

14 cups of flour - 5 cups of flour = 9 cups of flour

So Mary still needs to add 9 cups of flour.

Next, we need to find out how many cups of sugar the recipe calls for:

6 cups of sugar

Now we can find the difference between the amount of flour Mary needs to add and the amount of sugar the recipe calls for:

9 cups of flour - 6 cups of sugar = 3 cups more flour than sugar

Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.

To solve for x, we can subtract 21 from both sides: 

43 - 21 - x = 0 

Simplifying: 

22 - x = 0 

Finally, we can solve for x by subtracting 22 from both sides: 

x = 22

First, we can use the formula:

Total earnings = Earnings per week x Number of weeks

We know that Lewis earned a total of $1216 during the harvest and he earned $16 each week. So, we can substitute these values in the formula:

1216 = 16 x Number of weeks

To find the number of weeks, we need to isolate the variable (Number of weeks) on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 16:

1216/16 = Number of weeks

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

76 = Number of weeks

Therefore, the harvest lasted for 76 weeks.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many kids Julia played tag with in total. To do this, we can add the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday: 

12 + 14 = 26 

So Julia played tag with 26 kids in total. 

Next, we need to use the information about the time she spent playing tag to find out how long she played with each group of kids. We know that she spent a total of 34 hours playing tag on both days. Let's use a variable to represent the time she spent playing tag on Monday: 

Monday time = x 

We can use this variable to represent the time she spent playing tag on Tuesday as well: 

Tuesday time = 34 - x 

This is because we know that the total time she spent playing tag on both days is 34 hours, so if she spent x hours playing tag on Monday, she must have spent (34 - x) hours playing tag on Tuesday. 

Now we can set up an equation to solve for x: 

x/12 + (34 - x)/14 = 1 

The left side of the equation represents the fraction of the total time she spent playing tag with each group of kids. We set it equal to 1

Total tickets won = 14 + 12

Total tickets won = 26

Q: For 19 weeks of harvest Lewis earns a total of $ 133. How much money does he earn each week?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

We can start by using the formula:

Total earnings = Earnings per week x Number of weeks

We know that the total earnings for 19 weeks of harvest is $133. So we can plug that in:

$133 = Earnings per week x 19

To solve for the earnings per week, we can isolate it by dividing both sides by 19:

Earnings per week = $133 / 19

Using a calculator, we can simplify this to:

Earnings per week = $7

Therefore, Lewis earns $7 per week during the harvest. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is $7.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many movies are left after watching 63 of them. To do this, we can subtract 63 from the total number of movies:

17 movies - 63 movies = -46 movies

Wait a minute, we can't have negative movies! This means that we made a mistake somewhere. Let's check our work.

We were given that there are 17 movies and 11 books in the series. We also know that we watched 63 movies and read 13 books. To find out how many more movies than books there are, we need to subtract the number of books from the number of movies:

63 movies - 13 books = 50 more movies than books

Therefore, there are 50 more movies than books in the 'crazy silly school' series. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 50.

Q: 2 birds were sitting on the fence. Some more birds came to join them. If there are a total of 6 birds on the fence now How many more birds had come to sit on the fence?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume that x more birds came to join the two birds on the fence.

So, the total number of birds on the fence now is 2 + x (as there were initially 2 birds on the fence).

According to the problem, the total number of birds on the fence now is 6.

So, we can write an equation as:

2 + x = 6

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 6 - 2

x = 4

Therefore, 4 more birds had come to sit on the fence. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

Q: We ordered 7 pizzas. Each pizza has the same number of slices. If there were a total of 14 slices How many slices are there in each pizza?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of slices in all 7 pizzas. We can do this by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of slices in each pizza: 

7 pizzas x (number of slices in each pizza) = total number of slices 

We know that the total number of slices is 14, so we can substitute that in: 

7 pizzas x (number of slices in each pizza) = 14 slices 

Now we can solve for the number of slices in each pizza by dividing both sides by 7: 

(number of slices in each pizza) = 14 slices / 7 pizzas 

Simplifying: 

(number of slices in each pizza) = 2 slices 

Therefore, there are 2 slices in each pizza. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that Rachel picked 2 ripe apples from the tree. So, the tree originally had 2 + 7 = 9 apples on it.

Next, we know that out of the 7 apples still on the tree, 6 are ripe. So, the tree originally had 6 + unripe apples on it.

To find out how many ripe apples the tree had to begin with, we need to subtract the number of unripe apples from the total number of apples on the tree. We know that the total number of apples on the tree was 9, so we can set up an equation:

9 - unripe apples = number of ripe apples

We don't know how many unripe apples there were, but we can figure it out by using the information we have. We know that out of the 7 apples still on the tree, 6 are ripe. So, there is only 1 unripe apple left on the tree.

Now we can plug in the number of unripe apples into our equation:

9 - 1 = 8

So, the tree originally had 8 ripe apples on it. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 8.

We know that there are 700 girls, so the number of boys must be T - 700. 

We also know that there are 142 more boys than girls, so we can set up the equation: 

B = 700 + 142 

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation: 

T - 700 = 700 + 142 

Simplifying: 

T = 700 + 142 + 700 

T = 1542 

Therefore, there are 1542 pupils in the school. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1542.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many students can fit in all the buses combined. To do this, we can multiply the number of buses by the number of seats in each bus. 

46 buses x ? seats = total number of seats 

Next, we need to find out how many students need to be transported. We know there are 92 students in the school, but we don't know how many are going on the field trip. Let's assume all of them are going. 

92 students รท 17 classrooms = average of 5.41 students per classroom 

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, let's round up to 6 students per classroom. 

17 classrooms x 6 students = 102 students 

So, we need to transport 102 students. 

Now we can divide the total number of seats by the number of students to find out how many seats are in each bus. 

46 buses x ? seats = total number of seats 

46 buses x x seats = 102 students 

x = 102 students รท 46 buses

Q: In a school there are 632 girls and 410 boys. 465 more girls joined the school. How many more girls than boys does the school have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of girls in the school after 465 more girls joined. 

632 (original number of girls) + 465 (new girls) = 1097 girls 

Next, we can find the difference between the number of girls and boys: 

1097 (girls) - 410 (boys) = 687 

Therefore, the school has 687 more girls than boys. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 687.

Q: Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework, 11 pages of reading homework and 8 more pages of biology homework. How many more pages of reading homework than biology homework did she have?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pages of homework Rachel had in total. We can do this by adding up the number of pages for each subject:

7 pages of math + 11 pages of reading + 8 pages of biology = 26 pages of homework in total

Next, we need to find out how many more pages of reading homework Rachel had than biology homework. We can do this by subtracting the number of pages of biology homework from the number of pages of reading homework:

11 pages of reading - 8 pages of biology = 3 more pages of reading homework than biology homework

Therefore, Rachel had 3 more pages of reading homework than biology homework. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many animals were in the cage before any of the alligators were hiding. We can do this by adding the number of snakes and the number of alligators: 

93 snakes + 97 alligators = 190 animals 

Next, we need to subtract the number of alligators that were hiding from the total number of alligators: 

97 alligators - 40 hiding alligators = 57 alligators not hiding 

Therefore, there were 57 alligators that were not hiding in the cage. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 57.

61 parents + 177 pupils = 238 people

However, we know that the program could only seat 44 people. This means that some people had to stand or were not able to attend.

Therefore, the number of people present in the program is 44, which is the maximum number of people who could sit in the program.

Q: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches. 

Next, we know that the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. Let's call the distance the frog jumped "x". So the grasshopper jumped x + 4 inches. 

Finally, we know that the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog. So the mouse jumped x - 44 inches. 

We can set up an equation to solve for x: 

x + 4 + x - 44 = 19 

Simplifying: 

2x - 40 = 19 

Adding 40 to both sides: 

2x = 59 

Dividing by 2: 

x = 29.5 

So the frog jumped 29.5 inches.

Next, we know that each seat on the Ferris wheel can hold 2 people. 

To find the total number of seats on the Ferris wheel, we can divide the total number of people that can ride at the same time by the number of people each seat can hold: 

4 people รท 2 people per seat = 2 seats

Q: They decided to hold the party in their backyard. They have 14 chairs for each set of table. If they have 9 sets of tables How many more chairs than tables do they have?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many chairs they have in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of chairs per set of table by the number of sets of tables:

14 chairs/set x 9 sets = 126 chairs

So they have 126 chairs in total.

Next, we need to find out how many tables they have. We know they have 9 sets of tables, but we don't know how many tables are in each set. Let's assume each set has 1 table:

9 sets x 1 table/set = 9 tables

So they have 9 tables in total.

Finally, we can calculate how many more chairs they have than tables by subtracting the number of tables from the number of chairs:

126 chairs - 9 tables = 117 more chairs than tables

Therefore, they have 117 more chairs than tables. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 117.

Q: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 23 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they made $ 230 by selling t-shirts. How many t-shirts did they sell?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

We know that the Razorback t-shirt shop makes $23 off each t-shirt sold. 

Let's use "x" to represent the number of t-shirts sold. 

So, the total revenue made by selling "x" t-shirts would be:

Revenue = $23 * x

We also know that during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they made $230 by selling t-shirts. 

So, we can set up an equation:

$230 = $23 * x

To solve for "x", we can divide both sides by $23:

$230 / $23 = x

Simplifying:

10 = x

Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop sold 10 t-shirts during the game. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 10.

If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participate How many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 suggested adding bacon. So the total number of students who suggested either mashed potatoes or bacon is:

450 + 38 = 488

Now we need to find out how many students did not participate in the suggestion of new food items. We know that there were 66 choices in total, and we already accounted for 488 students. So the number of students who did not participate is:

66 - 488 = -422

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem together.

We know that mom bought 66 white t-shirts and each package has 3 white t-shirts. 

To find out how many packages she has, we need to divide the total number of t-shirts by the number of t-shirts in each package. 

So, we can use the following formula:

Number of packages = Total number of t-shirts / Number of t-shirts in each package

Plugging in the values we have:

Number of packages = 66 / 3

Simplifying the division:

Number of packages = 22

Therefore, mom will have 22 packages of white t-shirts.

Gwen received 5 dollars from her dad and 7 more dollars from her mom, so she received a total of 5 + 7 = 12 dollars. 

Next, we need to figure out how much money she had left after spending 4 dollars. 

Gwen spent 4 dollars, so she had 12 - 4 = 8 dollars left. 

Finally, we need to determine how much more money she received from her mom than from her dad. 

Gwen received 5 dollars from her dad and 7 more dollars from her mom, so her mom gave her 7 more dollars than her dad did. 

Therefore, Gwen received 7 more dollars from her mom than she did from her dad.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how far the frog jumped. We know that the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so we can set up an equation:

grasshopper's jump = frog's jump + 25

We also know that the grasshopper jumped 21 inches, so we can substitute that in:

21 = frog's jump + 25

Now we can solve for the frog's jump:

frog's jump = 21 - 25
frog's jump = -4

Uh oh, it looks like we have a problem. A negative jump doesn't make sense! We must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

Ah, I see the mistake. We should have set up the equation as:

grasshopper's jump = frog's jump + 25 + mouse's jump - 16

This takes into account that the mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog. Now we can substitute in the values we know:

21 = frog's jump + 25 + mouse's jump - 16

Simplifying:

21 = frog's jump + 9 + mouse's jump

12 = frog's jump + mouse's jump

Now we can use the fact that the grass

First, we need to find out how many tomatoes the farmer had before he picked any. We know that he had 171 tomatoes in his garden.

Next, we need to find out how many tomatoes he picked in total. We know that he picked 134 of them yesterday and 30 today. So, he picked a total of 134 + 30 = 164 tomatoes.

Finally, we need to subtract the number of tomatoes he picked from the total number of tomatoes he had to find out how many he has left. So, 171 - 164 = 7.

Therefore, the farmer will have 7 tomatoes left after today.

Let's assume that the weight of his dad's strawberries is "x" pounds.

According to the problem, Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds.

Together, their strawberries weighed 37 pounds.

So, we can write an equation to represent the given information:

15 + x = 37

Now, we can solve for "x" by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:

x = 37 - 15

x = 22

Therefore, his dad's strawberries weighed 22 pounds.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace in total on the given day. We know that 557 visitors came on that day and 188 visitors came the previous day. So, the total number of visitors in two days is:

557 + 188 = 745

Now, we need to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace on average per day. We can do this by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days:

745 / 2 = 372.5

So, on average, 372.5 visitors came to the Buckingham palace per day. 

Finally, we need to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace within 57 days. We can do this by multiplying the average number of visitors per day by the number of days:

372.5 x 57 = 21,217.5

Therefore, approximately 21,217 visitors visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days.

32 crackers + 98 cakes = 130 items

Next, we need to divide the total number of items by the number of friends to find out how many items each person received:

130 items รท 4 friends = 32.5 items per friend

However, we can't give half an item to each friend, so we need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means that each person received:

32 items per friend

Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes, we can divide the number of crackers by the number of friends to find out how many crackers each person received:

A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the grasshopper jumped 39 inches. 

Next, we know that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog. So, if we let x be the distance the frog jumped, then the grasshopper jumped x + 19 inches. 

Finally, we know that the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog. So, if we let y be the distance the mouse jumped, then the frog jumped y + 12 inches. 

Putting it all together, we have:

grasshopper = 39 inches
grasshopper = frog + 19 inches
frog = mouse + 12 inches

Substituting the second and third equations into the first equation, we get:

frog + 19 + frog + 12 = 39

Simplifying, we get:

2frog + 31 = 39

Subtracting 31 from both sides, we get:

2frog = 8

Dividing by 2, we get:

frog = 4

So, the frog jumped 4 inches. 

Using the third equation, we can find the distance the mouse jumped:

frog = mouse + 12
4 = mouse + 12
mouse = -8

Q: Emily is making bead necklaces for her friends. She had 2 beads and she was able to make 32 necklaces. How many beads did each necklace need?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of beads Emily used to make 32 necklaces. To do this, we can multiply the number of necklaces by the number of beads used in each necklace. 

So, if Emily used x beads in each necklace, then the total number of beads used would be:

32 * x

But we also know that Emily started with 2 beads. So the total number of beads used would be:

32 * x + 2

Now we can set up an equation to solve for x:

32 * x + 2 = total number of beads

We know that the total number of beads is not given in the problem, so we can't solve for x exactly. But we can simplify the equation by subtracting 2 from both sides:

32 * x = total number of beads - 2

Now we can see that the number of beads in each necklace is equal to:

(number of beads used in all necklaces) / (number of necklaces)

Or, in other words:

x = (total number of beads - 2) / 32

We still don't know the total number of beads, but we can use this equation to find out

Q: Danny collects bottle caps. He found 36 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 35 old ones. Now he has 22 bottle caps in his collection. How many more bottle caps did danny find at the park than those he threw away?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny found at the park. To do this, we can subtract the number of old ones he threw away from the total number of bottle caps he found:

36 - 35 = 1

So Danny found 1 new bottle cap at the park.

Next, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found the new one. To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps he has now from the total number he had after finding the new one:

36 - 1 - 22 = 13

So Danny had 13 bottle caps before he found the new one.

Finally, we can subtract the number of bottle caps Danny threw away from the number he found at the park to find out how many more he found than he threw away:

1 - 35 = -34

Uh oh, it looks like Danny threw away more bottle caps than he found at the park! We made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our calculations. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is N/A (since we made a mistake in our calculations)

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the total number of items on the shelf before Jerry added 2 more action figures.
- Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures on the shelf.
- Total number of items on the shelf = 3 + 4 = 7

Step 2: Find the total number of items on the shelf after Jerry added 2 more action figures.
- Jerry added 2 more action figures to the shelf.
- Total number of items on the shelf = 7 + 2 = 9

Step 3: Find the difference between the number of action figures and books on the shelf.
- Number of action figures on the shelf = 4 + 2 = 6
- Number of books on the shelf = 3
- Difference between the number of action figures and books = 6 - 3 = 3

Therefore, there were 3 more action figures than books on Jerry's shelf after he added 2 more action figures. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: Bryan took a look at his books as well. He has 7 bookshelves with each having the same number of books. If he has a total of 28 books How many books are there in each bookshelf?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Bryan has 7 bookshelves with the same number of books on each shelf. Let's call the number of books on each shelf "x". 

So, the total number of books Bryan has is the product of the number of bookshelves and the number of books on each shelf: 

Total number of books = 7x 

We know that the total number of books is 28, so we can set up an equation: 

7x = 28 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 7: 

x = 4 

Therefore, there are 4 books on each bookshelf. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

Jack received a total of 9 emails in the day. 

This means that the sum of the emails he received in the morning and afternoon is 9.

If he received 7 emails in the morning, we can subtract that from the total to find out how many emails he received in the afternoon.

9 - 7 = 2

Therefore, Jack received 2 emails in the afternoon.

Q: 17 red peaches and 16 green peaches are in the basket. How many more red peaches than green peaches are in the basket?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the total number of peaches in the basket.
To find the total number of peaches in the basket, we need to add the number of red peaches and the number of green peaches. So, 

Total number of peaches = 17 + 16 = 33

Step 2: Find the difference between the number of red peaches and green peaches.
To find the difference between the number of red peaches and green peaches, we need to subtract the number of green peaches from the number of red peaches. So,

Difference = Number of red peaches - Number of green peaches
Difference = 17 - 16
Difference = 1

Therefore, there is only 1 more red peach than green peach in the basket. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There were 89 bird families living near the mountain. If 60 bird families flew away for winter How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many bird families stayed behind. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the total number of bird families: 

89 - 60 = 29 

So, 29 bird families stayed behind. 

Next, we need to find out how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of bird families that stayed behind from the number of bird families that flew away: 

60 - 29 = 31 

Therefore, 31 more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 31.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much strawberries Marco and his dad collected together before his dad lost 8 pounds. We know that they collected 36 pounds of strawberries in total. 

So, if Marco's strawberries weighed 12 pounds, then his dad's strawberries must have weighed:

36 pounds - 12 pounds = 24 pounds

Now, we need to subtract the 8 pounds that his dad lost on the way back:

24 pounds - 8 pounds = 16 pounds

Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 16 pounds after he lost 8 pounds on the way back. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 16.

28 + 52 = 80 sacks of oranges per day

Next, we need to find out how many sacks of oranges they will have after 26 days of harvest. To do this, we can multiply the number of sacks of oranges per day by the number of days:

80 x 26 = 2080 sacks of oranges after 26 days of harvest

Therefore, they will have 2080 sacks of oranges after 26 days of harvest.

Haley gave 2 marbles to each boy. Let's call the number of boys "b".

So, the total number of marbles Haley gave away can be represented as 2b.

We know that Haley gave away 28 marbles in total. So, we can set up an equation:

2b = 28

To solve for "b", we can divide both sides by 2:

b = 14

Therefore, Haley gave the marbles to 14 boys.

We know that Carol bought 3 packs of invitations, and each pack has the same number of invitations. Let's call the number of invitations in each pack "x". 

So, we can write an equation: 

3x = 12 

This equation means that the total number of invitations (3x) is equal to 12 (the number of friends Carol is inviting). 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3: 

3x/3 = 12/3 

Simplifying: 

x = 4 

Therefore, there are 4 invitations in each pack. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 4.

Q: 41 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop some children got off the bus. Then there were 18 children left on the bus. How many more children were on the bus before the bus stop than there are now?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

We know that there were 41 children on the bus before some got off at the bus stop. So, let's say x children got off the bus.

That means, the number of children left on the bus after some got off is 41 - x.

Now, we are given that there were 18 children left on the bus after some got off. So, we can set up an equation:

41 - x = 18

To solve for x, we can subtract 18 from both sides:

41 - 18 - x = 0

23 - x = 0

x = 23

Therefore, 23 children got off the bus at the bus stop.

To answer the original question, we can subtract the number of children left on the bus after some got off from the initial number of children on the bus:

41 - 18 = 23

So, there were 23 more children on the bus before the bus stop than there are now. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 23.

Next, we know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. So, Jake has 18 - 12 = 6 peaches. 

We also know that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. Let's call the number of peaches Jill has "J". So, we can write an equation: 

18 = J + 8 

To solve for J, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtract 8 from both sides: 

18 - 8 = J 

Simplify: 

10 = J 

So, Jill has 10 peaches.

11 friends x 2 crackers/friend = 22 crackers 

So Matthew gave away 22 crackers. 

Next, we need to figure out how many crackers Matthew had to begin with. We don't have this information, but we do know that he gave away 22 crackers and we can use that to set up an equation:

We can simplify this to: 

Matthew's original crackers = remaining crackers + 22 crackers 

We don't know how many crackers Matthew had left after giving some away, but we do know that he gave away all of his crackers to his friends. Therefore, we can say that the remaining crackers are equal to zero: 

Matthew's original crackers = 0 + 22 crackers 

Matthew's original crackers = 22 crackers 

So Matthew had 22 crackers to begin with.

Q: For Gwen's birthday she received some dollars. She spent 8 dollars and has 6 dollars left with her. How much money did Gwen receive for her birthday?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down.

Let's assume the amount of money Gwen received for her birthday is "x" dollars.

She spent 8 dollars, so the amount of money she has left is (x - 8) dollars.

We also know that she has 6 dollars left with her, so we can set up an equation:

x - 8 = 6

Now we can solve for x:

x = 6 + 8

x = 14

Therefore, Gwen received 14 dollars for her birthday. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 14.

Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. If 218 students suggested adding mashed potatoes as well as bacon while 351 suggested adding only bacon to the menu How many students suggested adding bacon?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that 218 students suggested adding mashed potatoes as well as bacon. We also know that 351 students suggested adding only bacon. 

To find out how many students suggested adding bacon in total, we can add these two numbers together: 

218 + 351 = 569 

Therefore, 569 students suggested adding bacon to the menu. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 569.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out Dean's height. We know that Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron, who is 12 feet tall. So, Dean's height is:

12 - 11 = 1 foot

Next, we need to find out the depth of the water. We know that the depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height. So, the depth of the water is:

5 x 12 = 60 feet

Therefore, the depth of the water is 60 feet. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 60.

Q: 5 storks and 3 birds were sitting on the fence. 4 more birds came to join them. How many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

First, we need to find the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence. We can do this by adding the number of storks and birds given in the problem:

5 storks + 3 birds = 8 animals on the fence

Next, we need to add the 4 more birds that came to join them:

8 animals on the fence + 4 birds = 12 animals on the fence

Now, we need to find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence. To do this, we can subtract the number of storks from the total number of animals on the fence:

12 animals on the fence - 5 storks = 7 more birds than storks sitting on the fence

Therefore, there are 7 more birds than storks sitting on the fence. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 7.

Q: Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 8 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Ed lose?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can use algebra to represent the problem. Let's say that Doug has x marbles. Then, according to the problem, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug, so Ed has x + 19 marbles.

Next, we know that Ed lost some marbles at the playground. Let's say he lost y marbles. After losing y marbles, Ed has x + 19 - y marbles.

Finally, we know that Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug. So, we can set up an equation:

x + 8 = x + 19 - y

Simplifying this equation, we get:

8 = 19 - y

y = 11

Therefore, Ed lost 11 marbles at the playground. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 11.

Q: In a school there are 635 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 510 more boys than girls How many boys are there in that school?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we can set up an equation to represent the given information. Let's call the number of boys "b". 

We know that there are 635 girls, so the total number of students in the school is:

b + 635

We also know that there are 510 more boys than girls, so:

b = 635 + 510

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(b + 635) = (635 + 510) + 635

Simplifying this equation, we get:

b + 635 = 1145

Subtracting 635 from both sides, we get:

b = 510

Therefore, there are 510 boys in the school. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 510.

Q: Tiffany was collecting cans for recycling. On monday she had 7 bags of cans. The next day she found 12 more bags worth of cans. How many more bags did she find on the next day than she had on monday?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the total number of bags of cans Tiffany had on Monday and the next day.
- On Monday, Tiffany had 7 bags of cans.
- The next day, she found 12 more bags worth of cans. So, the total number of bags she had on the next day is 7 + 12 = 19 bags.

Step 2: Find the difference between the number of bags she had on the next day and Monday.
- To find the difference, we need to subtract the number of bags she had on Monday from the number of bags she had on the next day.
- So, the difference is 19 - 7 = 12 bags.

Step 3: Answer the question.
- The question asks how many more bags Tiffany found on the next day than she had on Monday.
- So, the answer is 12 bags. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 12.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pencils and crayons Faye has in total. To do this, we can use multiplication:

- Pencils: 7 rows x 36 pencils per row = 252 pencils
- Crayons: 7 rows x 30 crayons per row = 210 crayons

So Faye has a total of 252 pencils and 210 crayons.

Next, the question asks specifically for the number of crayons Faye has. So we can simply state:

- Faye has 210 crayons. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 210.

Q: Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 3 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 27 marbles How many marbles did Doug have initially?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we know that Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug. So, we can write:

Ed = Doug + 5

Next, we know that Ed had 27 marbles. So, we can substitute that into the equation above:

27 = Doug + 5

Now, we can solve for Doug:

Doug = 27 - 5

Doug = 22

Therefore, Doug had 22 marbles initially.

But we also know that Doug lost 3 of his marbles at the playground. So, we can subtract 3 from his initial amount:

Doug = 22 - 3

Doug = 19

Therefore, Doug had 19 marbles after losing 3 at the playground. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 19.

38 pieces/block x 78 blocks = 2964 pieces of junk mail 

Next, we need to find the total number of houses the mailman will deliver to. To do this, we can multiply the number of blocks by the number of houses per block: 

19 houses/block x 78 blocks = 1482 houses 

Finally, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the total number of houses to find the number of pieces of junk mail per house: 

2964 pieces of junk mail รท 1482 houses = 2 pieces of junk mail per house 

Therefore, the mailman should give each house 2 pieces of junk mail.

4 slices/pizza x 17 pizzas = 68 slices

So, we have 68 slices of pizza in total. 

Next, we need to find the total number of slices needed for 25 people. Since each person will likely have more than one slice, we can multiply the number of people by an estimated number of slices per person. Let's assume each person will have 3 slices:

25 people x 3 slices/person = 75 slices

Therefore, we need a total of 75 slices of pizza for 25 people. 

Since we have 68 slices in total, we can conclude that we need more pizza. We would need to order at least 19 pizzas to have enough slices for everyone. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 75 slices.

Uh oh, it looks like we ended up with a negative number. This means that Paul doesn't have any crayons left, and he actually gave away more than he had. 

To answer the question of how many more crayons he gave to his friends than those he lost, we can calculate the difference between the two:

571 - 161 = 410

So Paul gave away 410 more crayons than he lost. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 410.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many guests actually came. If Brenda's mother made cookies for 10 guests but only 1 guest came, then we know that 10 - 9 = 1 guest came.

Next, we need to figure out how many cookies were left after the guests who came had their share. If Brenda's mother made 18 cookies and only 1 guest came, then we know that 18 - X = the number of cookies left, where X is the number of cookies each guest had.

Since each guest had the same number of cookies, we can divide the number of cookies left by the number of guests who came to find out how many cookies each guest had. So, X = (18 - X) / 1.

Simplifying this equation, we get 2X = 18, which means that X = 9. Therefore, each guest had 9 cookies. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

Adam could fit 10 action figures on each shelf in his room. This means that the capacity of each shelf is 10 action figures.

His room could hold 8 action figures. This means that the total number of action figures that can be accommodated in his room is 8.

To find out how many total shelves his room has, we need to divide the total number of action figures by the capacity of each shelf. 

So, the total number of shelves in Adam's room would be:

8 action figures / 10 action figures per shelf = 0.8 shelves

Since we cannot have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Adam's room has 1 shelf. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1 shelf.

Q: After making some pies, chef had 2 apples left. Initially he had 43 apples How many apples did he use?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

We know that the chef started with 43 apples. 

We also know that he ended up with 2 apples after making some pies. 

So, to find out how many apples he used, we can subtract the number of apples he ended up with from the number of apples he started with. 

43 - 2 = 41 

Therefore, the chef used 41 apples to make the pies. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 41.

Q: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 5 cups of sugar and 13 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 12 more cups of flour How many cups of flour did she put in?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we know that the recipe calls for 13 cups of flour in total. Mary already put in some cups of flour, so let's call that amount "x". 

That means she still needs 12 more cups of flour, so we can set up an equation: 

x + 12 = 13 

Solving for x, we can subtract 12 from both sides: 

x = 1 

So Mary already put in 1 cup of flour. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 1.

Q: Jack received 6 emails in the morning, 3 emails in the afternoon and some more in the evening. If he received a total of 10 emails in the day How many emails did Jack receive in the afternoon?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon. So, the total number of emails he received in the morning and afternoon is:

6 + 3 = 9

Now, we know that Jack received a total of 10 emails in the day. So, the number of emails he received in the evening can be found by subtracting the number of emails he received in the morning and afternoon from the total number of emails he received in the day:

10 - 9 = 1

Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the evening. 

To answer the original question, we know that Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.

Q: After Jessie started to go jogging everyday she lost 126 kilograms. She currently weighs 66 kilograms. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

We know that Jessie lost 126 kilograms after starting to jog. So, we can assume that her weight before starting to jog was her current weight plus the weight she lost. 

That is, 

Weight before starting to jog = Current weight + Weight lost 

Substituting the given values, we get: 

Weight before starting to jog = 66 + 126 

Weight before starting to jog = 192 kilograms 

Therefore, Jessie weighed 192 kilograms before starting to jog. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 192.

Q: Julia played tag with 7 kids on monday and 13 kids on tuesday. She played cards wtih 20 kids on wednesday. How many kids did she play tag with altogether?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find the total number of kids Julia played tag with on Monday and Tuesday. 

To do this, we can add the number of kids she played with on each day: 

7 + 13 = 20 

So Julia played tag with 20 kids on Monday and Tuesday combined. 

Next, we need to add the number of kids she played cards with on Wednesday: 

20 + 20 = 40 

Therefore, Julia played with a total of 40 kids altogether. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 40.

Q: Paul had 42 pens and 143 books. After selling some books and pens in a garage sale he had 113 books and 19 pens left. How many pens did he sell in the garage sale?
A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem into smaller steps.

Step 1: Find the difference in the number of books before and after the garage sale.
To do this, we subtract the number of books after the garage sale from the number of books before the garage sale:
143 - 113 = 30

Step 2: Find the difference in the number of pens before and after the garage sale.
To do this, we subtract the number of pens after the garage sale from the number of pens before the garage sale:
42 - 19 = 23

Step 3: Determine how many pens were sold in the garage sale.
Since we know that the difference in the number of pens before and after the garage sale is 23, we can conclude that Paul sold 23 pens in the garage sale.

Therefore, Paul sold 23 pens in the garage sale. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 23.

Q: Robin's hair was 14 inches long. It grew by 8 inches. Then he cut off 20 inches. How long is his hair now?
A: Let's think step by step. First, Robin's hair grew by 8 inches, so we can add 8 to 14 to get the length of his hair before he cut it: 

14 + 8 = 22 

Next, he cut off 20 inches from his hair, so we can subtract 20 from the length we just found: 

22 - 20 = 2 

Therefore, Robin's hair is now 2 inches long. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 2.

A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of bird families that flew away for the winter. We can do this by adding the number of bird families that flew to Africa and the number of bird families that flew to Asia:

38 + 80 = 118

Therefore, 118 bird families flew away for the winter. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 118.

A: Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem.

Rachel picked 2 apples from 1 of her trees, which means the tree now has 7 apples left on it. 

We can use subtraction to find out how many apples the tree had to begin with. 

If the tree now has 7 apples, and Rachel picked 2 apples from it, then the tree originally had:

7 + 2 = 9 apples 

Therefore, the tree had 9 apples to begin with. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 9.

Q: There are 16 different books and 14 different movies in the ' crazy silly school ' series. If you read 19 of the books and watched 13 of the movies How many more books than movies are there in the ' crazy silly school ' series?
A: Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many books and movies are left in the series after reading 19 books and watching 13 movies. 

Number of books left = 16 - 19 = -3 (We can't have negative books, so we know that we have read all the books in the series)

Number of movies left = 14 - 13 = 1 

So, there are 3 more books than movies in the 'crazy silly school' series. 
Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is 3.
