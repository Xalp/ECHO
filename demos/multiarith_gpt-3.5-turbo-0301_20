If each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, then the total time it will take to cook 9 potatoes is 9 x 5 = 45 minutes. Therefore, it will take the chef 45 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.",

Similarly, he has 5 piles of dimes, and each pile has 3 dimes. So, he has a total of 5 x 3 = 15 dimes. Therefore, the total number of coins he has is 15 quarters + 15 dimes = 30 coins.",

She has 2 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has 7 books, so she has 2 x 7 = 14 picture books. Finally, we can add the number of mystery books and picture books together to find the total number of books Megan has. 56 + 14 = 70 books in total. Therefore, Megan has a total of 70 books.",

Next, we need to find out how many trips he will make to pick up the 2 trays from the other table. Since he can only carry 4 trays at a time, he will only need to make 1 trip to pick up the 2 trays.

Each box has 6 pieces inside it, so Tom gave away a total of 7 x 6 = 42 pieces of chocolate candy.

To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 ÷ 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples.
