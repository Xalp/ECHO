Step 4: To find out how many boxes he needed, we can divide the total number of games by the number of games in each box: 16 ÷ 8 = 2.

Each box has 6 pieces inside it, so Tom had a total of 12 x 6 = 72 pieces of chocolate candy. Tom gave 7 boxes to his little brother. Each box has 6 pieces inside it, so Tom gave away a total of 7 x 6 = 42 pieces of chocolate candy. To find out how many pieces Tom still had, we need to subtract the number of pieces he gave away from the total number of pieces he had. So, Tom still had 72 - 42 = 30 pieces of chocolate candy.",

To find out how many toys he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each toy: $30 ÷ $6 = 5 Therefore, Will can buy 5 six-dollar toys with the money he has left after buying the new game.",

To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 ÷ 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples. So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples. Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples.",

Each adult meal costs $2, so for 7 adults, the total cost would be 7 x $2 = $14. Since the kids eat for free, we don't need to factor in any additional costs for them.
