Next, we need to find the total time Emily spent putting together each piece of furniture, which is 8 minutes per piece. To find the total time Emily spent putting together all the furniture, we can multiply the number of furniture pieces by the time spent on each piece: 6 pieces x 8 minutes per piece = 48 minutes.

Since there are 6 pages and each page has 4 problems, we can multiply 6 x 4 to get 24 reading problems.

Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if only 10 students wanted fruit. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 ÷ 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples. So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples. Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples.",

Next, 2 more players joined the game. So, we need to add their lives to the total. Each player has 7 lives, so 2 players would have 2 x 7 = 14 lives.

We can do this by subtracting the cost of the blades from the amount of money he made: 69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars Now we know that Mike has 45 dollars left to spend on games. To find out how many 5 dollar games he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game: 45 dollars ÷ 5 dollars/game = 9 games Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left after buying the new mower blades.",

Each box has 6 pieces inside it, so Tom gave away a total of 7 x 6 = 42 pieces of chocolate candy.

Now, we can find the total cost of all the flowers Vanessa bought by multiplying the number of flowers by the cost of each flower. So, the total cost is 6 x 8 = 48 dollars.
