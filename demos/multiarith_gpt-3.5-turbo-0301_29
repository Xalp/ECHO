We can do this by subtracting the cost of the game from his initial amount of money: $57 - $27 = $30 Now we know that Will has $30 left to spend on toys. We also know that each toy costs $6. To find out how many toys he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each toy: $30 ÷ $6 = 5 Therefore, Will can buy 5 six-dollar toys with the money he has left after buying the new game.",

We know that there are 9 people in total and 2 of them are kids, so that means there are 9 - 2 = 7 adults. Next, we need to calculate the cost for the adults' meals. Each adult meal costs $2, so for 7 adults, the total cost would be 7 x $2 = $14. Since the kids eat for free, we don't need to factor in any additional costs for them.

She has 2 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has 7 books, so she has 2 x 7 = 14 picture books. Finally, we can add the number of mystery books and picture books together to find the total number of books Megan has. 56 + 14 = 70 books in total. Therefore, Megan has a total of 70 books.",

Since there are 6 pages and each page has 4 problems, we can multiply 6 x 4 to get 24 reading problems.

Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if only 10 students wanted fruit. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 ÷ 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples. So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples. Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples.",

To find out how many 5 dollar games he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game: 45 dollars ÷ 5 dollars/game = 9 games Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left after buying the new mower blades.",
